<p>1:1 <i>The</i> book of lineage of Jesus Christ, <i>the</i> son of David, <i>the</i> son of Abraham: 
1:2 Abraham fathered Isaac; and Isaac fathered Jacob; and Jacob fathered Judah and his brethren; 
1:3 and Judah fathered Perez and Zerah from Tamar; and Perez fathered Hezron; and Hezron fathered Ram; 
1:4 and Ram fathered Amminadab; and Amminadab fathered Nahshon; and Nahshon fathered Salmon; 
1:5 and Salmon fathered Boaz from Rahab; and Boaz fathered Obed from Ruth; and Obed fathered Jesse; 
1:6 and Jesse fathered David, the king.</p>
<br>
<p>And David, the king, fathered Solomon from the <i>widow</i> of Uriah; 
1:7 and Solomon fathered Rehoboam; and Rehoboam fathered Abijah; and Abijah fathered Asa; 
1:8 and Asa fathered Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat fathered Jehoram; and Jehoram fathered Uzziah; 
1:9 and Uzziah fathered Jotham; and Jotham fathered Ahaz; and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah; 
1:10 and Hezekiah fathered Manasseh; and Manasseh fathered Amon; and Amon fathered Josiah; 
1:11 and Josiah fathered Jechoniah and his brethren, at <i>the time of</i> the exile of Babylon.</p>
<br>
<p>1:12 And after the exile of Babylon, Jechoniah fathered Shealtiel; and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel; 
1:13 and Zerubbabel fathered Abiud; and Abiud fathered Eliakim; and Eliakim fathered Azor; 
1:14 and Azor fathered Sadoc; and Sadoc fathered Achim; and Achim fathered Eliud; 
1:15 and Eliud fathered Eleazar; and Eleazar fathered Matthan; and Matthan fathered Jacob; 
1:16 and Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called* the Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 1:1-17 &amp; Lk 3:23-28 Mary’s Genealogy.}</p>
<p>1:17 Therefore, all the generations from Abraham until David <i>were</i> fourteen generations; and from David until the exile of Babylon, <i>were</i> fourteen generations; and from the exile of Babylon until the Christ, <i>were</i> fourteen generations.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 1:18-25 Nazareth 5 BC; no parallel.}</p>
<p>1:18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus: for* when* his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found <i>to be</i> pregnant {Greek: in womb holding} from the Holy Spirit. 
1:19 Now Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man and not willing to disgrace her, planned to divorce her secretly. 
1:20 But when* he was contemplating these things, behold, a messenger of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary to you, <i>as</i> your wife for* what was born {Or: conceived} in her is from the Holy Spirit. 
1:21 Now she will bear a son, and you will call his name Jesus, for* he will save his people from their sins. 
1:22 Now this whole thing has happened, in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, 
1:23 ‘Behold, the virgin will be pregnant, and will bear a son, and they will call his name Immanuel'; which is, <i>after</i> being translated, ‘God with us.’ {Isa 7:14, 8:8, 10} 
1:24 Now having been aroused from his sleep, Joseph did as the messenger of the Lord commanded him and took his wife to him; 
1:25 and did not know her <i>intimately</i> until she bore her firstborn son, and he called his name Jesus.</p>
<h3>Matthew 2</h3>
<p>{Mt 2:1-12 Jerusalem &amp; Bethlehem 4 BC; no parallel.}</p>
<p>2:1 Now when* Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise-men {Persian Magi; v7 &amp; v16} from the east came into Jerusalem, 
2:2 saying, Where is he who has been born <i>the</i> King of the Jews? For* we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him. 
2:3 Now when* Herod the king heard it, he was disturbed and everyone <i>in</i> Jerusalem with him. 
2:4 And having gathering together all the high-priests and scribes of the people, he inquired from them where the Christ should be born.</p>
<p>2:5 Now they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea; for* thus it has been written through the prophet, 
2:6 ‘And Bethlehem, a land of Judah, you are by no means least among the governors of Judah; for* a leader will come forth from you, who will shepherd my people Israel.’ {Mic. 5:2, 2Sam 5:2}</p>
<br>
<p>2:7 Then Herod, having called the wise-men secretly, ascertained accurately from them the time of the star’s appearing. 
2:8 And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, While* you* are traveling, probe out accurately <i>the things</i> concerning the young child. And whenever you* have found <i>him</i>, report to me, *that I <i>may</i> also come and may worship him. 
2:9 Now having heard the king, they traveled <i>away</i>. And behold, the star, which they saw in the east, was preceding them until it came and stood above where the young child was. 
2:10 Now having seen the star, they rejoiced <i>with</i> extremely great joy. 
2:11 And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother. They fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh to him. {Isa 60:6, Psa  72:10, 15} 
2:12 And having been divinely-warned in a dream not to revisit Herod, they departed into their own region through another way.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 2:13-18 Leaving for Egypt 4 BC; no parallel.}</p>
<p>2:13 Now when* they had departed, behold, a messenger of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream, saying, When* you arise, take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I should tell you, because Herod is about to seek the young child to destroy him. 
2:14 Now he arose, and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt; 
2:15 and they were there until the end of Herod; in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, ‘Out of Egypt I called my son.’ {Hos. 11:1} 
2:16 Then Herod, having seen that he was mocked by the wise-men, was exceedingly furious, and sent forth <i>soldiers and</i> assassinated all the boys who <i>were</i> in Bethlehem, and in all her borders, from two years and downward, according to the time which he had ascertained accurately from the wise-men. 
2:17 Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, 
2:18 ‘A voice was heard in Ramah, mourning, and weeping, and much anguish, Rachel weeping <i>for</i> her children. And she did not wish to be comforted, because they are not <i>there</i>.’ {Jer. 31:15}</p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 2:19-23 &amp; Lk 2:39b Egypt &amp; Nazareth 4 BC.}</p>
<p>2:19 But when* Herod was dead*, behold, a messenger of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 
2:20 saying, When* you arise, take the young child and his mother, and travel into the land of Israel, for* those seeking the young child’s life have died. 
2:21 Now he arose and took the young child and his mother and entered into the land of Israel. 
2:22 But when* he heard that Archelaus is reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and having been divinely-warned in a dream, he departed into the parts of Galilee, 
2:23 and having come, he dwelt in a city called* Nazareth; *that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, that he will be called a Nazarene.</p>
<h3>Matthew 3</h3>
<p>{Mk 1:1-8 &amp; Mt 3:1-12 &amp; Lk 3:1-18. Judea near Jordan River 25 or 26 AD.}</p>
<p>3:1 Now in those days John the Immerser* comes, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, 
3:2 and saying, Repent; for* the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near. 
3:3 For* this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, ‘A voice <i>is</i> crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord, make* his paths straight.’ {Isa 40:3} 
3:4 Now John himself had his <i>outer</i> clothing <i>made</i> of camel’s hair and a leather belt around his loin, and his nourishment was locusts and wild honey. 
3:5 Then Jerusalem and everyone <i>in</i> Judea and everyone <i>from</i> the region around the Jordan were traveling out to him. 
3:6 And they were being immersed* by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins. 
3:7 But when* he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion*, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who warned you* to flee from the future wrath? 
3:8 Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance. 
3:9 Do not think to say among yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for* I say to you*, that God is able to lift up children out of these stones for Abraham. 
3:10 But even already, the ax is laid to the root of the trees, because every tree which is not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire. 
3:11 I indeed immerse* you* in water toward repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier <i>than</i> I, whose shoes I am not sufficient to bear. He will immerse* you* in the Holy Spirit; 
3:12 whose winnowing fan <i>is</i> in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and he will gather his grain into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:9-11 &amp; Mt 3:13-17 Lk 3:21-22 Jordan east of Jericho, Spring 27 AD.}</p>
<p>3:13 Then Jesus comes from Galilee to John, to be immersed* by him in the Jordan. 
3:14 But John was preventing him, saying, I have need to be immersed* by you and you are coming to me?</p>
<p>3:15 But Jesus answered and said to him, <b>Allow <i>it</i> now; for* thus it is suitable for us to fulfill every righteousness.</b> Then he allows him.</p>
<p>3:16 And Jesus when* he was immersed*, came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down, like a dove, and coming upon him; 
3:17 and behold, a voice <i>came</i> out of the heavens, saying, <b>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am delighted.</b></p>
<h3>Matthew 4</h3>
<p>{Mk 1:12-13 &amp; Mt 4:1-11 &amp; Lk 4:1-13.}</p>
<p>4:1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil. 
4:2 And having fasted forty days and forty nights, later he hungered. 
4:3 And the Tempter came and said to him, If you are the Son of God, speak, in order that these stones may become bread.</p>
<p>4:4 But he answered and said, <b>It has been written, ‘Man will not live on bread alone, but upon every declaration that goes-onward through the mouth of God!’</b> {Deu. 8:3}</p>
<p>4:5 Then the Devil takes him into the holy city. And he stands him upon the pinnacle of the temple, 
4:6 and says to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself downward; for* it has been written, ‘He will command the messengers concerning you, and they will lift you up upon <i>their</i> hands, lest you hit your foot against a stone.' {Psa 91:11-12}</p>
<p>4:7 Jesus said to him, <b>Again it has been written, ‘Do not test the Lord, your God.’</b> {Deu. 6:16}</p>
<p>4:8 Again, the Devil takes him to an exceedingly high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; 
4:9 and he says to him, I will give you all these things, if you fall down and worship me.</p>
<p>4:10 Then Jesus says to him, <b>Go behind me, Adversary! For* it has been written, ‘You will worship the Lord your God and you will give-divine service to him only.’</b> {Deu. 6:13} 
4:11 Then the Devil leaves him, and behold, messengers came and were serving him.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:14a &amp; Mt 
4:12 &amp; Lk 3:19-20 &amp; Jn 4:1-4 Judea to Galilee.}</p>
<p>4:12 Now Jesus, having heard that John was given up, departed into Galilee.</p>
<p>{Mt 4:13-16 Capernaum.}</p>
<p>4:13 And having left Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali; 
4:14 in order that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, 
4:15 ‘The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond-that of the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, 
4:16 the people who sat in darkness saw a great light and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, light has risen for them.’ {Isa 9:1-2}</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:14b-15 &amp; Mt 
4:17 &amp; Lk 4:14b-15.}</p>
<p>4:17 From then <i>onward</i>, Jesus began to preach and to say, <b>Repent; for* the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:16-20 &amp; Mt 4:18-22 &amp; Lk 5:1-11 Sea of Galilee near Capernaum.}</p>
<p>4:18 Now walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon who is called* Peter and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for* they were fishermen. 
4:19 And he says to them, <b>Come-here after me and I will make* you* fishermen of men.</b> 
4:20 Now immediately, they left the nets and followed him. 
4:21 And having advanced from there, he saw two other brothers, James, the <i>son</i> of Zebedee and John, his brother, in the ship with Zebedee, their father, mending their nets. And he called them. 
4:22 Now immediately they followed him having left the ship and their father.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:35-39 &amp; Mt 4:23-25 &amp; Lk 4:42-44 Preaching through Galilee.}</p>
<p>4:23 And Jesus was going around the whole <i>of</i> Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good-news of the kingdom and healing every <i>kind of</i> disease and every <i>kind of</i> illness among the people. 
4:24 And the report of him went forth into the whole <i>of</i> Syria and they brought to him all who were ill, held by various diseases and torments and demon-possessed and epileptic and paralytics, and he healed them. 
4:25 And large crowds followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond-that of the Jordan.</p>
<h3>Matthew 5</h3>
<br>
<p>{Mt 
5:1 &amp; Lk 6:17-20. Sermon on the mountain.}</p>
<p>5:1 Now having seen the crowds, he went up into the mountain and having sat down, his disciples came to him.</p>
<p>{Mt 5:2-12 &amp; Lk 6:20-26.}</p>
<p>5:2 And he opened his mouth and was teaching them, saying: 
5:3 <b>The poor in spirit <i>are</i> fortunate, because theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</b> 
5:4 <b>Those who are mourning <i>are</i> fortunate, because they will be comforted.</b> 
5:5 <b>The meek <i>are</i> fortunate, because they will inherit the earth.</b> 
5:6 <b>Those who hunger and are thirsty <i>for</i> righteousness <i>are</i> fortunate, because they will be fed.</b> 
5:7 <b>The merciful are fortunate, because they will be shown-mercy.</b> 
5:8 <b>The clean in heart <i>are</i> fortunate, because they will see God.</b> 
5:9 <b>The peacemakers <i>are</i> fortunate, because they will be called sons of God.</b> 
5:10 <b>Those who have been persecuted because of righteousness are fortunate, because theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</b> 
5:11 <b>You* are fortunate whenever they reproach and persecute you* and say every evil word against you*– lying, because of me.</b> 
5:12 <b>Rejoice and be glad, because your* reward is much in the heavens; for* thus, they persecuted the prophets who <i>were</i> before you*.</b></p>
<p>{Mt 5:13-16; no parallel.}</p>
<p>5:13 <b>You* are the salt of the earth, but if the salt is flavorless, <i>then</i> with* what shall it be salted? It is still not strong-enough <i>to be used</i> *for anything, except to be cast outside and trampled by men.</b> 
5:14 <b>You* are the light of the world. A city laying upon a mountain is not able to be hid.</b> 
5:15 <b>Nor are they burning a lamp and placing it under a peck container, but upon the lamp-stand, and it is shining to all who are in the house.</b> 
5:16 <b>So let your* light shine before men, *that they may see your* good works and may glorify your* Father who <i>is</i> in the heavens.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 5:17-48 &amp; Lk 6:27-36.}</p>
<p>5:17 <b>Do not suppose that I came to tear-down the law or the prophets; I did not come to tear-down, but to fulfill.</b> 
5:18 <b>For* assuredly I am saying to you*, Until heaven and earth should pass away, one iota or one serif may never* pass away from the law, until all things should become <i>fulfilled</i>.</b></p>
<p>5:19 <b>Therefore, whoever loosens one of these least commandments and may teach men <i>to do</i> so, will be called least in the kingdom of the heavens, but whoever practices and should teach them, he will be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.</b> 
5:20 <b>For* I am saying to you*, that if your* righteousness does not abound more-than <i>that</i> of the scribes and Pharisees, you* may never* enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</b></p>
<br>
<p>5:21 <b>You* have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Do not murder,' but ‘whoever murders will be liable to the judgment.’</b> {Ex. 
20:13 &amp; Deu. 5:17} 
5:22 <b>But I say to you*, that everyone who is vainly angry {</b>Or: with emptiness (without cause or reason; i.e. to further one's own vanity)<b>} to<i>ward</i> his brother will be liable to the judgment, and whoever says to his brother, You, empty-head, will be liable to the council, but whoever says, You fool, will be liable to the hell of fire.</b> {Empty-head is an expression of contempt. The Greek here could be simply ‘fool’ said as an expression of condemnation or could be a transliteration of ‘Moreh’ which is a Hebrew expression of condemnation. In Mt 
5:22 the wording doesn’t matter; it’s the way it is said or meant.}</p>
<br>
<p>5:23 <b>Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar, and <i>while you are</i> there, you should remember that your brother has something against you,</b> 
5:24 <b>leave your gift there before the altar and go away. First be reconciled to your brother and then come and offer your gift.</b> 
5:25 <b>Be agreeable with your opponent quickly, while you are with him on the road; lest the opponent should give you to the judge and the judge should give you to the attendant and you will be cast into prison.</b> 
5:26 <b>Assuredly I am saying to you, You may never* come out from there, until you should have repaid the last copper coin.</b></p>
<br>
<p>5:27 <b>You* have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’</b> {Ex. 
20:14 &amp; Deu. 5:18} 
5:28 <b>But I say to you*, that everyone who is looking <i>at</i> a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</b> 
5:29 <b>Now if your right eye is offending you, pluck it out and cast it from you*; for* it is advantageous for you, that* one of your members should perish and not <i>that*</i> your whole body should be cast into hell.</b> 
5:30 <b>And if your right <i>hand</i> is offending you, cut it off and cast <i>it</i> away from you*; for* it is advantageous for you, that* one of your members should perish and not <i>that*</i> your whole body should be cast into hell.</b></p>
<p>5:31 <b>It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a <i>document of</i> divorcement.’</b> {Deu. 24:1, 3} 
5:32 <b>But I say to you*, that whoever divorces his wife, except-for <i>the</i> reason of fornication, is making* her commit adultery and whoever marries her who has been divorced is committing adultery.</b> {Mt 19:9, Lk 16:18}</p>
<br>
<p>5:33 <b>Again, you* have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘You will not perjure yourself, but will give your oaths to the Lord.’</b> {Lev. 19:12, Num. 30:2, Deu. 23:21} 
5:34 <b>But I am saying to you*, Do not swear in anyway; neither by the heaven, because it is the throne of God;</b> 
5:35 <b>nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of his feet; nor in Jerusalem, because it is the city of the Great King,</b> 
5:36 <b>nor should you swear by your head, because you are unable to make* one hair white or black.</b> 
5:37 <b>But let your* word be, a Yes, yes; a No, no; and whatever is more-than these, is from the evil <i>one</i>.</b></p>
<br>
<p>5:38 <b>You* have heard that it was said, An eye in exchange-for an eye and a tooth in exchange-for a tooth.</b> {Ex. 21:24, Lev. 24:20, Deu.19:21} 
5:39 <b>But I am saying to you*, Do not stand against an evil <i>man</i>, but who<i>ever</i> slaps you upon your right jaw, turn also the other to him.</b> 
5:40 <b>And to him, who is willing to go to court with you and <i>wants</i> to take away your tunic, <i>then</i> also allow for him <i>to take your outer</i> garment.</b> 
5:41 <b>And who<i>ever</i> compels you <i>to go</i> one mile, go with him two.</b> 
5:42 <b>Give to him who asks you and do not turn away from the one who wishes to borrow from you.</b></p>
<br>
<p>5:43 <b>You* have heard that it was said, ‘You will love* your neighbor and hate your enemy.’</b> {Lev. 19:18} 
5:44 <b>But I am saying to you*, Love* your* enemies, speak well of those who curse you*, do good <i>things</i> to those who hate you* and pray on behalf of those who are railing at you* and are persecuting you*.</b> 
5:45 <i><b>Do this</b></i> <b>*that you* may become sons of your* Father who is in the heavens, because his sun rises upon the evil and the good and <i>it</i> rains upon the righteous and the unrighteous.</b> 
5:46 <b>For* if you* love* those who love* you*, what reward do you* have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?</b> 
5:47 <b>And if you* only greet your* friends, what are you* doing more-than <i>others</i>? Are not even the tax collectors doing so?</b> 
5:48 <b>Therefore you* will be complete, just-like your* Father who is in the heavens is complete.</b></p>
<h3>Matthew 6</h3>
<p>{Mt 6:1-34; no parallel.}</p>
<p>6:1 <b>Take-heed not to do your* charity before men, to be seen by them, otherwise you* have no reward from your* Father who is in the heavens.</b></p>
<p>6:2 <b>Therefore, whenever you are doing charity, do not sound <i>a trumpet</i> before you just-like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the lanes, *that they may be glorified by men. Assuredly I am saying to you*, They are having their reward.</b> 
6:3 <b>But <i>when</i> you are doing charity, do not let your left <i>hand</i> know what your right <i>hand</i> is doing,</b> 
6:4 *<b>that your charity may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will repay you openly.</b></p>
<br>
<p>6:5 <b>And whenever you* pray, do not be just-like the hypocrites, because they love to pray, standing in the synagogues and at the street corners, *that they may appear <i>devout</i> to men. Assuredly I am say to you*, that they are having their reward.</b> 
6:6 <b>But you, whenever you pray, enter into your storeroom, and when* you have locked your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will repay you openly.</b> 
6:7 <b>And <i>while</i> praying, do not be repetitious just-like the Gentile; for* they think that they will be heard in their many words.</b> 
6:8 <b>Therefore, do not be similar to them, for* your* Father knows what things you* have need of before you* ask him.</b> 
6:9 <b>Therefore pray thus: our Father who <i>is</i> in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.</b> 
6:10 <b>Let your kingdom come. Let your will happen as in heaven, also upon the earth.</b> 
6:11 <b>Give our</b> {F} <b>needful bread to us today.</b> 
6:12 <b>And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.</b> 
6:13 <b>And do not bring us into temptation, but rescue us from the evil <i>one</i>, because yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever. Amen.</b> 
6:14 <b>For* if you* forgive men their trespasses, your* heavenly Father will also forgive you*.</b> 
6:15 <b>But if you* do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your* Father forgive your* trespasses.</b></p>
<br>
<p>6:16 <b>Now whenever you* fast, do not become just-like the hypocrites, <i>with</i> a gloomy face; for* they disfigure their faces, *that they may appear to men <i>to be</i> fasting. Assuredly I am saying to you*, They are having their reward.</b> 
6:17 <b>But <i>as for</i> you, <i>when</i> you are fasting, anoint your head and wash your face</b> 
6:18 *<b>that you do not appear to be fasting to men, but to your Father who <i>is</i> in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.</b></p>
<br>
<p>6:19 <b>Do not store up treasures for you upon the earth, where moth and rust ingest, and where thieves burrow through <i>your* wall</i> and steal.</b> 
6:20 <b>But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust ingest, and where thieves do not burrow through or steal.</b> 
6:21 <b>For* where your* treasure is, your* heart will also be there.</b></p>
<p>6:22 <b>The lamp of the body is the eye, because if your eye is clear, your whole body will be radiant.</b> 
6:23 <b>But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. Therefore, if the light which is in you is darkness, how much <i>greater</i> is the darkness!</b></p>
<p>6:24 <b>No one is able to serve* two lords, for* either he will hate the one and love* the other; or he will hold to one and despise the other. You* are not able to serve* God and</b> {F} <b>money.</b></p>
<p>6:25 <b>Because of this, I am saying to you*, Do not be anxious for your* life, what you* may eat and what you* may drink; nor for what you* may clothe your* body with. Is not the life <i>worth</i> more-than the nourishment and the body <i>worth more-than</i> the clothing?</b> 
6:26 <b>Look at the birds of the heaven, that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, and your* heavenly Father is nourishing them. Are you* not carrying much more-value than them?</b> 
6:27 <b>Now which <i>one</i> out of you* is able to add one cubit upon his stature <i>by</i> being anxious?</b> 
6:28 <b>And why are you* anxious concerning clothing? Learn from the lilies of the field, somehow they are growing; they are not laboring, nor spinning.</b> 
6:29 <b>Yet I say to you*, that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.</b> 
6:30 <b>But if God so dresses-up the grass of the field, which is <i>here</i> today and the next-day is cast into the oven, <i>will he</i> not much more <i>clothe</i> you*? You* of small faith!</b></p>
<p>6:31 <b>Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What should we eat? or, What should we drink? or, What should we dress ourselves with?</b> 
6:32 <b>For* the Gentiles are seeking after all these things; for* your* heavenly Father knows that you* have needs of all these things.</b> 
6:33 <b>But first seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you*.</b> 
6:34 <b>Therefore do not be anxious *for the next-day; for* the next-day will be anxious <i>enough</i> for the things of itself. Its evil is enough for the <i>one</i> day.</b></p>

<h3>Matthew 7</h3>
<p>{Mt 7:1-6 &amp; Lk 6:37-42; similar Jn 5:30, 7:24.}</p>
<p>7:1 <b>Do not judge, that* you* might not be judged!</b> 
7:2 <b>For* in what judgment you* judge, you* will be judged and in what measure you* measure, it will be measured again to you*.</b> 
7:3 <b>And why do you see the speck which is in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the beam which is in your own eye?</b> 
7:4 <b>Or how will you say to your brother, Allow <i>me, that</i> I may cast out the speck from your eye, and behold, the beam <i>which is</i> in your own eye?</b> 
7:5 <b>You hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see precisely to cast out the speck from your brother’s eye.</b></p>
<br>
<p>7:6 <b>Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your* pearls before the swine, lest they trample them down with* their feet and having turned, they may rip at you*.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 7:7-11; no parallel.}</p>
<p>7:7 <b>Ask and it will be given to you*; seek and you* will find; knock and it will be opened to you*.</b> 
7:8 <b>For* everyone who is asking, receives; and the one who is seeking, finds; and to the one who is knocking, it will be opened.</b> 
7:9 <b>Or what man is there out of you*, who, if his son asks him for a loaf he will not give him a stone, will he?</b> 
7:10 <b>Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a serpent, will he?</b> 
7:11 <b>Therefore if you*, being evil, know how to give good presents to your* children, how much more will your* Father who is in the heavens give good things to those who are asking him?</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 
7:12 &amp; Lk 6:31.}</p>
<p>7:12 <b>Therefore, all things, as many as you* would wish that* men should do for you*, so do also to them; for* this is the law and the prophets.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 7:13-23 &amp; Lk 6:43-45.}</p>
<p>7:13 <b>Enter in through the narrow gate, because wide is the gate and broad is the way, which leads to destruction and there are many who are entering through it.</b> 
7:14 <b>Why <i>is it</i>? Narrow is the gate and pressed is the way, which is leading to life and few are those who are finding it.</b></p>
<br>
<p>7:15 <b>But take-heed of false prophets, who are coming to you* in sheep’s clothing, but inside are ravenous wolves.</b> 
7:16 <b>You* will fully know them from their fruits. They do not collect a grape-cluster from thorns or figs from thistles, do they?</b> 
7:17 <b>Thus every good tree produces good fruit, but the rotten tree produces evil fruit.</b> 
7:18 <b>A good tree is not able to produce evil fruit, nor is a rotten tree able to produce good fruit.</b> 
7:19 <b>Every tree <i>which is</i> not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</b> 
7:20 <b>Consequently*, you* will fully know them from their fruits.</b> 
7:21 <b>Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who is practicing the will of my Father who is in the heavens.</b> 
7:22 <b>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not: prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and practice many miracles in your name?</b> 
7:23 <b>And then I will confess to them, I never* knew you*. Depart from me, you* who work lawlessness.</b></p>
<p>{Mt 7:24-29 &amp; Lk 6:46-49.}</p>
<p>7:24 <b>Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and practices them, he will be similar to a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock;</b> 
7:25 <b>and the rain came down and the rivers came <i>up</i> and the winds blew and fell down upon that house, and it did not fall; for* it had been founded upon the rock.</b>  
7:26 <b>And everyone hearing these words of mine and who <i>is</i> not doing them, will be similar to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand;</b> 
7:27 <b>and the rain came down and the rivers came <i>up</i> and the winds blew and hit that house and it fell and great was its fall.</b></p>
<br>
<p>7:28 And it happened, when Jesus <i>had</i> completed <i>with</i> these words, the crowds were being astounded at his teaching; 
7:29 for* he was teaching them like <i>one</i> having authority and not like the scribes.</p>
<br>
<h3>Matthew 8</h3>
<p>{Mt 8:1, 8:5-13 &amp; Lk 7:1-10 Capernaum.}</p>
<p>8:1 Now having come down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:40-45 &amp; Mt 8:2-4 &amp; Lk 5:12-16.}</p>
<p>8:2 And behold, a leper having come to him, was worshiping him, saying, Lord, if you are willing, you are able to cleanse me.</p>
<p>8:3 And Jesus, having stretched out his hand, touched him, saying, <b>I am willing; be cleansed.</b> And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 
8:4 And Jesus says to him, <b>See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, *for a testimony to them.</b> {Lev. 13:49, 14:2-4}</p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 8:1, 8:5-13 &amp; Lk 7:1-10 Capernaum.}</p>
<p>8:5 Now when* Jesus entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, pleading with him, 
8:6 and saying, Lord, my young-servant, a paralytic, has been put in the house, terribly tormented.</p>
<p>8:7 And Jesus says to him, <b>I will come and heal him.</b></p>
<p>8:8 And the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not sufficient that* you should come under my roof, but only speak by word and my young-servant will be healed. 
8:9 For* I am a man also under authority, having soldiers under me and I say to this one, Go-onward and he goes-onward, and to another, Come and he comes, and to my bondservant, Do this and he does <i>it</i>.</p>
<p>8:10 Now when* Jesus heard it, he marveled and said to those who followed, <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, I have not found so-great a faith, not even in Israel.</b> 
8:11 <b>But I am saying to you*, that many will come from the east and the west, and will recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens;</b> 
8:12 <b>but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness– the weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be there.</b> 
8:13 Now Jesus said to the centurion, <b>Go, and as you have believed, let it happen for you.</b> And his young-servant was healed in that hour.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:29-34 &amp; Mt 8:14-17 &amp; Lk 4:38-41 Capernaum.}</p>
<p>8:14 And when* Jesus had come into Peter’s house, he saw that his mother-in-law had been put <i>in bed</i> and fevered. 
8:15 And he touched her hand and the fever left her, and she arose and was serving him. 
8:16 Now when* it became evening, they brought to him many demon-possessed and he cast out the spirits by word and healed all who were ill; 
8:17 *that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, ‘He himself took our weaknesses and bears our diseases.’ {Isa 53:4}</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 4:35-41 &amp; Mt:8:18-27 &amp; Lk 8:22-25 Sea of Galilee.}</p>
<p>8:18 Now when* Jesus saw large crowds around him, he gave commands to go away beyond-that <i>area</i>. 
8:19 And one scribe, having come to him, said, Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.</p>
<p>8:20 And Jesus says to him, <b>The foxes have burrows and the birds of the heaven <i>have</i> nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere he may bow his head.</b></p>
<p>8:21 Now a different <i>one</i> of his disciples said to him, Lord, permit me first to go away and bury my father.</p>
<p>8:22 But Jesus said to him, <b>Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.</b></p>
<br>
<p>8:23 And having stepped into the ship, his disciples followed him. 
8:24 And behold, a great squall happened in the sea, so-that the ship was hidden by the waves, but he was sleeping. 
8:25 And the disciples came to him and aroused him, saying, Save us Lord! We are perishing!</p>
<p>8:26 And he says to them, <b>Why are you* cowardly? You* of small faith!</b> Then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there became a great calm.</p>
<p>8:27 Now the men marveled, saying, What sort of <i>man</i> is this, that even the winds and the sea are obeying* him?</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 5:1-21 &amp; Mt 8:28-34 &amp; Lk 8:26-40 Gergesa.}</p>
<p>8:28 And having come to the <i>area</i> beyond-that into the region of the Gergesenes, two demon-possessed <i>men</i> met him, coming forth out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so-that not anyone was strong-enough to pass through that way. 
8:29 And behold, they cried out, saying, What <i>is this thing</i> with us and with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time? 
8:30 Now a herd of many swine was being fed from afar, away from them. 
8:31 And the demons were pleading with him, saying, If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine.</p>
<p>8:32 And he said to them, <b>Go away!</b> Now they came out and went into the herd of swine and behold, all the herd of swine rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the waters. 
8:33 Now those who are feeding them fled and went away into the city and reported all things and what <i>had happened to</i> those who were demon-possessed. 
8:34 And behold, all the city came out *for a meeting with Jesus and when* they saw him, they pleaded with <i>him</i> *that he should proceed from their borders.</p>
<h3>Matthew 9</h3>
<p>9:1 And he stepped into the ship and ferried over and came into his own city.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 2:1-12 &amp; Mt 9:2-8 &amp; Lk 5:17-26.}</p>
<p>9:2 And behold, they were bringing a paralytic to him, having been put upon a cot, and Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic, <b>Child, have courage; your sins have been forgiven.</b></p>
<p>9:3 And behold, some of the scribes said among themselves, This one is blaspheming.</p>
<br>
<p>9:4 And Jesus, having seen their contemplations said, <b>Why are you* contemplating evil in your* hearts?</b> 
9:5  <b>For* what is easier, to say, Your sins have been forgiven; or to say, Arise and walk?</b> 
9:6 <b>But in order that you* may know that the Son of Man has authority upon the earth to forgive sins</b> (then he says to the paralytic), <b>While* you are arising, lift up your cot and go away to your house.</b> 
9:7 And having arisen, he went away to his house. 
9:8 Now when* the crowds saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 2:13-14 &amp; Mt 
9:9 &amp; Lk 5:27-28 At or near Capernaum.}</p>
<p>9:9 And passing by from there, Jesus saw a man, called* Matthew, sitting at a tax-office and he says to him, <b>Follow me.</b> And he stood up and followed him.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 2:15-22 &amp; Mt 9:10-17 &amp; Lk 5:29-39 Capernaum.}</p>
<p>9:10 And it happened, <i>while he was</i> reclining <i>at a meal</i> in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined together with Jesus and his disciples. 
9:11 And when* the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why is your* teacher eating with the tax collectors and sinners?</p>
<p>9:12 But Jesus having heard it, said to them, <b>Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.</b> 
9:13 <b>Now go-onward and learn what is <i>meant by</i>, ‘I will <i>to have</i> mercy and not sacrifice.’</b> {Hos. 6:6} <b>For* I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</b></p>
<br>
<p>9:14 Then the disciples of John come near to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but your disciples do not fast?</p>
<p>9:15 And Jesus said to them, <b>The sons of the bridal-party</b> {companions or guests} <b>are not able to mourn, inasmuch as the bridegroom is with them, are they? But the days will come, whenever the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast.</b> 
9:16 <b>But no one puts a patch of unshrunk fabric upon an old garment; for* its fullness <i>shrinks and</i> lifts away from the garment and a worse split happens.</b> 
9:17 <b>Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst and the wine is poured out and the wineskins will be destroyed, but they put new wine into new wineskins and both are protected together.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 5:22-43 &amp; Mt 9:18-26 &amp; Lk 8:41-56 Capernaum.}</p>
<p>9:18 <i>While</i> speaking these things to them, behold, one ruler came to him and was worshiping <i>him</i>, saying, My daughter is <i>just</i> now dead*, but come and lay your hand upon her and she will live. 
9:19 And Jesus and his disciples arose and followed him.</p>
<p>9:20 And behold, a woman, having <i>had</i> a flow of blood <i>for</i> twelve years, came behind <i>him</i> and touched the hem of his garment; 
9:21 for* she was saying to herself, ‘If only I touch his garment; I will be cured.</p>
<p>9:22 Now Jesus having turned, saw her, and said, <b>Daughter, have courage; your faith has cured you.</b> And the woman was cured from that hour.</p>
<br>
<p>9:23 And when* Jesus came into the ruler’s house and saw the flute-players and the crowd being in an uproar, 
9:24 he says to them, <b>Depart; for* the girl is not dead, but is sleeping.</b> And they were laughing at him. 
9:25 But when* the crowd was cast out, having entered, he took-hold of her hand, and the girl arose. 
9:26 And this fame went forth into that whole land.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 9:27-34 Probably Capernaum; no parallel.}</p>
<p>9:27 And Jesus passing by from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, Show-mercy to us, son of David.</p>
<p>9:28 Now having come into the house, the blind men came to him and Jesus says to them, <b>You* believe that I am able to do this?</b></p>
<p>They say to him, Yes, Lord.</p>
<p>9:29 Then he touched their eyes, saying, <b>Let it happen for you* according to your* faith.</b> 
9:30 And their eyes were opened. And Jesus scolded them, saying, <b>See that <i>you*</i> let no one know it.</b> 
9:31 But they went forth and broadcasted <i>about</i> him in that whole land.</p>
<br>
<p>9:32 Now when* they are going forth, behold, they brought a demon-possessed mute man to him. 
9:33 And when* the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke and the crowds marveled, saying, This was never* so seen in Israel.</p>
<p>9:34 But the Pharisees were saying, He is casting out demons by the ruler of the demons.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 6:6b-13 &amp; Mt 9:35-
10:42 &amp; Lk 9:1-6 Third circuit of Galilee.}</p>
<p>9:35 And Jesus was going around all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good-news of the kingdom and healing all <i>kinds of</i> disease and all <i>kinds of</i> illness among the people. 
9:36 But when* he saw the crowds, he had compassion concerning them, because they were fainting <i>in spirit</i> and were being tossed <i>about</i>, like sheep not having a shepherd. 
9:37 Then he says to his disciples, <b>The harvest is indeed large, but the workers are few.</b> 
9:38 <b>Therefore beseech from the Lord of the harvest, *that he should put out workers into his harvest.</b></p>
<h3>Matthew 10</h3>
<p>10:1 And having called his twelve disciples, he gave to them authority <i>over</i> unclean spirits, so-that <i>they are able</i> to cast them out, and to heal every <i>kind of</i> disease and every <i>kind of</i> illness.</p>
<br>
<p>10:2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: the first <i>is</i> Simon, who is called* Peter and Andrew his brother; James and John his brother, the <i>sons</i> of Zebedee; 
10:3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the <i>son</i> of Alphaeus and Lebbaeus who was surnamed Thaddaeus; 
10:4 Simon the Canaanite {Or: zealot. See Lk. 6:15, Acts 1:13.} and Judas the Iscariot, who gave him up to the Jews.</p>
<br>
<p>10:5 Jesus sent forth these twelve <i>apostles</i> and commanded them, saying, <b>Do not go into <i>any</i> road of the Gentiles and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans;</b> 
10:6 <b>but travel rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</b> 
10:7 <b>Now while* you* are traveling, preach, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.</b> 
10:8 <b>Heal the sick; cleanse the lepers; cast out demons; freely you* received, freely <i>you*</i> give.</b> 
10:9  <b>Do not procure gold, nor silver, nor brass <i>coins</i> *for your* <i>money</i> belts;</b> 
10:10 <b>no knapsack *for <i>your</i>* journey, neither two tunics nor shoes nor staffs; for* the worker is worthy of his nourishment.</b> 
10:11 <b>Now into whatever city or village you* enter, probe out who is worthy in it, and abide there until you* should go.</b> 
10:12 <b>Now <i>while</i> entering into the house, greet it.</b> 
10:13 <b>And if indeed the house is worthy, let your* peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your* peace return to you*.</b> 
10:14 <b>And whoever does not accept you*, nor hears your* words, when* you* go forth from <i>that</i> house or that city, shake-off the dust from your* feet.</b> 
10:15 <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, It will be more tolerable <i>for the</i> land of Sodom and Gomorrah in <i>the</i> day of judgment, than for that city.</b></p>
<br>
<p>10:16 <b>Behold, I am sending you* forth like sheep in the midst of wolves; therefore, become prudent like serpents and harmless like doves.</b> 
10:17 <b>But take-heed of men; for* they will give you* up to councils, and they will scourge you* in their synagogues;</b> 
10:18 <b>and you* will also be led in front of governors and kings because of me, *for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.</b> 
10:19  <b>But whenever they give you* up, do not be anxious how or what you* should speak; for* it will be given to you* in that hour what you* will speak.</b> 
10:20 <b>For* it is not you* who speaks, but the Spirit of your* Father who speaks in you*.</b> 
10:21 <b>Now brother will give up brother to death and the father his child and children will stand up against parents and will slay them.</b> 
10:22  <b>And you* will be hated by all men because of my name. But he who has endured to the end, this one will be saved.</b> 
10:23 <b>But whenever they persecute you* in this city, flee into another; for* assuredly I am saying to you*, You* may never* complete the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man should come.</b></p>
<br>
<p>10:24 <b>A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a bondservant above his lord.</b> 
10:25 <b>It is enough for the disciple that* he should become like his teacher and the bondservant like his lord. If they have called the householder Beelzebub, how much more the kinfolk!</b>  
10:26 <b>Therefore do not fear them; for* there is nothing hidden, which will not be revealed, and <i>nothing</i> secret, which will not be known.</b> 
10:27 <b>What I tell you* in the darkness, speak in the light, and what you* hear in <i>your</i>* ear, preach upon the housetops.</b> 
10:28 <b>And do not be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul, but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</b> 
10:29 <b>Are two sparrows not sold for a copper coin? And not one out of them will fall to the earth without your* Father <i>knowing it</i>;</b> 
10:30 <b>but even the hairs of your* head are all numbered.</b> 
10:31 <b>Therefore do not fear, <i>because</i> you* are carrying more-value than many sparrows.</b> 
10:32 <b>Therefore, everyone who will confess <i>to be</i> in me before men, I will also confess <i>to be</i> in him before my Father, who is in the heavens.</b> 
10:33 <b>But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.</b></p>
<br>
<p>10:34 <b>Do not suppose that I came to cast peace upon the earth; I did not come to cast peace, but a sword.</b>  
10:35 <b>For* I came to pit man against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;</b> 
10:36 <b>and, ‘A man’s enemies <i>will be</i> his own kinfolk.’</b> {Mic 7:6} 
10:37 <b>He who loves <i>his</i> father or mother above me is not worthy of me, and he who loves <i>his</i> son or daughter above me is not worthy of me.</b> 
10:38 <b>Now he who is not taking <i>up</i> his cross and following after me, is not worthy of me.</b> 
10:39 <b>He who has found his life will lose it, and he who has lost his life because of me will find it.</b></p>
<br>
<p>10:40 <b>He who accepts you*, accepts me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me.</b> 
10:41 <b>He who accepts a prophet in the name of a prophet, will receive a prophet’s reward, and he who accepts a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, will receive a righteous man’s reward.</b> 
10:42 <b>And whoever gives only a cup of cold water to drink to one of these little ones, in the name of a disciple, assuredly I am saying to you*, He may never* lose his reward.</b></p>
<h3>Matthew 11</h3>
<p>11:1 And it happened when Jesus <i>had</i> completed commanding his twelve disciples, he proceeded from there to teach and to preach in their cities.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 11:2-30 &amp; Lk 7:18-35 Galilee.}</p>
<p>11:2 Now when* John heard the works of the Christ <i>while</i> in prison, he sent two of his disciples 
11:3 and said to him, Are you the one who is coming, or <i>should</i> we expect a different <i>one</i>?</p>
<p>11:4 And Jesus answered and said to them, <b>When* you* travel <i>back</i>, report to John what you* hear and see:</b> 
11:5  <b>the blind recover their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised and the poor have the good-news proclaimed to them.</b> 
11:6 <b>And whoever is not offended at me is fortunate.</b></p>
<br>
<p>11:7 Now while* these <i>disciples</i> are traveling <i>on</i>, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, <b>What did you* come out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</b> 
11:8 <b>But what did you* go out to see? A man who has been dressed-up in soft garments? Behold, those who are wearing soft <i>garments</i> are in royal houses.</b> 
11:9 <b>But why did you* go out? To see a prophet? I say to you*, Yes, and one <i>who is</i> more-than a prophet.</b> 
11:10 <b>For* this is he, concerning whom it has been written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’</b> {Mal. 3:1} 
11:11 <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, A greater <i>man</i> has not arisen among those born from women <i>than</i> John the Immerser*. But he who is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater <i>than</i> he.</b> 
11:12 <b>But from the days of John the Immerser* until now the kingdom of the heavens suffers-violently and <i>the</i> violent seize it.</b> 
11:13 <b>For* all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</b> 
11:14 <b>And if you* are willing to accept <i>it</i>, this is Elijah, who is about to come.</b>  
11:15 <b>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</b></p>
<br>
<p>11:16 <b>But to what shall be similar to this generation? It is similar to children sitting in the marketplaces and shouting to their comrades</b> 
11:17 <b>and saying, We piped to you* and you* did not dance. We mourned for you* and <i>yet</i> you* did not grieve for yourselves.</b> 
11:18 <b>For* John came neither eating nor drinking and they say, He has a demon.</b> 
11:19 <b>The Son of Man came eating and drinking and they say, Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! And wisdom was justified from her children.</b></p>
<br>
<p>11:20 Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his miracles had happened, because they did not repent. 
11:21 <b>Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles had happened in Tyre and Sidon which have happened in you*, they would have repented long-ago in sackcloth and ashes.</b>  
11:22 <b>However I say to you*, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in <i>the</i> day of judgment than for you*.</b>  
11:23 <b>And you, Capernaum, who has been exalted to heaven, you will step down to Hades, because if the miracles had happened in Sodom which have happened in you, it would have remained till today.</b>  
11:24 <b>However I say to you*, that it will be more tolerable for <i>the</i> land of Sodom in <i>the</i> day of judgment, than for you.</b></p>
<br>
<p>11:25 Jesus answered and said at that time, <b>I profess you, <i>O</i> Father, Lord of heaven and the earth, that you hid these things from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to infants.</b> 
11:26 <b>Yes, Father, because thus it became a delight before you.</b> 
11:27 <b>All things have been given to me by my Father and no one fully knows the Son, except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father fully, except the Son and he to whomever the Son wills to reveal <i>him.</i></b> 
11:28 <b>Come-here to me, all you* who labor and have been loaded <i>down,</i> and I will give-rest to you*.</b> 
11:29 <b>Take my yoke upon you* and learn from me, because I am meek and humble in heart and you* will find rest for your* souls.</b> 
11:30 <b>For* my yoke is easy and my load is light.</b></p>
<h3>Matthew 12</h3>
<p>{Mk 2:23-28 &amp; Mt 12:1-8 &amp; Lk 6:1-5 Jerusalem to Galilee.}</p>
<p>12:1 Jesus traveled on the Sabbath day through the grainfields at that time, and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck the tops and to eat <i>them</i>. 
12:2 But the Pharisees, having seen <i>it</i>, said to him, Behold, your disciples are doing what is not legal to practice upon the Sabbath.</p>
<p>12:3 But he said to them, <b>Have you* not read what David did, when he himself was hungry and those with him;</b> 
12:4 <b>how he entered into the house of God and ate the showbread, which was not legal for him to eat, nor those with him, <i>unlawful</i> except for the priests only?</b>  
12:5 <b>Or have you* not read in the law, that on the Sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and <i>yet</i> are crimeless?</b> {1Sam. 21:6} 
12:6 <b>But I saying to you*, that a greater <i>than</i> the temple is here.</b>  
12:7 <b>But if you* had known what is <i>meant by this</i>, ‘I will <i>to have</i> mercy and not sacrifice,’</b> {Hos. 6:6} <b>You* would not have sentenced the crimeless.</b> 
12:8 <b>For* the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 3:1-6 &amp; Mt 12:9-14 &amp; Lk 6:6-11 Probably Galilee.}</p>
<p>12:9 And having proceeded from there, he went into their synagogue. 
12:10 And behold, there was a man who had a dried up hand. And they asked him, in order that they might accuse him, saying, Is it legal to heal on the Sabbath day?</p>
<p>12:11 But he said to them, <b>What man shall there be out of you*, who shall have one sheep and if this <i>one</i> falls into a ditch on the Sabbath day, shall he not take-hold of it and lift <i>it</i> up?</b> 
12:12 <b>Then* how much more-value does a man carry than a sheep? So-then it is legal to do good on the Sabbath day?</b></p>
<p>12:13 Then he says to the man, <b>Stretch out your hand.</b> And he stretched it out, and it was restored <i>as</i> healthy as the other. 
12:14 But the Pharisees having gone out, took counsel against him, *that they should destroy him.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 3:7-12 &amp; Mt 12:15-21 Sea of Galilee.}</p>
<p>12:15 But Jesus having known <i>it</i>, departed from there and large crowds followed him, and he healed them all, 
12:16 and rebuked them, that* they should not make* him apparent; 
12:17 *that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, 
12:18 ‘Behold, my young-servant whom I selected. My beloved in whom my soul is delighted. I will place my Spirit upon him and he will proclaim judgment to the Gentiles.’ 
12:19 ‘He will not have selfish ambition, nor will he cry-out; nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets. 
12:20 He will not fracture a bruised reed and he will not quench a smoking wick, until he should cast out the judgment to victory. 
12:21 And the Gentiles will hope in his name.’ {Isa 42:1-3}</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 3:19b-30 &amp; Mt 12:22-37.}</p>
<p>12:22 Then a demon-possessed <i>man</i> was brought to him, blind and mute and he healed him, so-that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw. 
12:23 And all the crowds were astonished and were saying, This is not the son of David, is it?</p>
<p>12:24 But when* the Pharisees heard it, they said, This one is not casting out demons, except in Beelzebub the ruler of the demons.</p>
<p>12:25 But Jesus knowing their contemplations said to them, <b>Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.</b> 
12:26 <b>And if the Adversary casts out the Adversary, he is divided against himself. Then* how will his kingdom stand?</b> 
12:27 <b>And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, in whom do your* sons cast them out? They will be your* judges because of this.</b> 
12:28 <b>But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God; consequently*, the kingdom of God has arrive-unexpectedly upon you*.</b> 
12:29 <b>Or how is anyone able to enter into the house of the strong <i>man,</i> and plunder his goods, if he does not first bind the strong <i>man</i>? And then he will plunder his house.</b> 
12:30 <b>He who is not with me is against me and he who does not gather with me scatters.</b> 
12:31  <b>Because of this, I am saying to you*, Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit will not be forgiven.</b> 
12:32 <b>And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, not in the age <i>which is</i> now, nor in the future <i>one</i>.</b> 
12:33 <b>Either make* the tree good and its fruit good; or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for* the tree is known from its fruit.</b> 
12:34  <b>Offspring of vipers! How are you*, being evil, able to speak good things? For* out of the abundance of the heart the mouth is speaking.</b> 
12:35 <b>The good man out of his good treasure is casting out good things and the evil man out of his evil treasure is casting out evil things.</b> 
12:36 <b>But I am saying to you*, that every idle declaration, whatever men speak, they will give an account in <i>the</i> day of judgment concerning it.</b> 
12:37 <b>For* you will be justified from your words and you will be sentenced from your words.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 12:38-45; no parallel.}</p>
<p>12:38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered <i>him</i>, saying, Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.</p>
<p>12:39 But he answered and said to them, <b>An evil and adulterous generation is seeking after a sign, and a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet;</b> 
12:40 <b>for* just-as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea-creature; so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</b></p>
<p>12:41 <b><i>The</i> men <i>of the</i> Ninevites will stand up with this generation in the judgment and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, more-than Jonah <i>is</i> here.</b> 
12:42 <b>The queen of the south will be arisen with this generation in the judgment and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, more-than Solomon <i>is</i> here.</b></p>
<p>12:43 <b>But the unclean spirit, whenever it has gone out of the man, goes through waterless places, seeking rest and does not find it.</b> 
12:44 <b>Then it says, I will return into my house from where I came out, and when it comes, it finds it unoccupied, having been swept and adorned.</b>  
12:45 <b>Then it travels and takes with itself seven other spirits <i>more</i> evil <i>than</i> itself and they enter and dwell there and the last <i>state</i> of that man becomes worse <i>than</i> the first. So it will also be to this evil generation.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 3:31-35 &amp; Mt 12:46-50 &amp; Lk 8:19-21.}</p>
<p>12:46 But <i>while he is</i> still speaking to the crowds, behold, <i>his</i> mother and his brethren stood outside, seeking to speak to him. 
12:47 Now someone said to him, Behold, your mother and your brethren are standing outside, seeking to speak to you.</p>
<p>12:48 But he answered and said to him who spoke to him, <b>Who is my mother? And who are my brethren?</b> 
12:49 And he stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said, <b>Behold, my mother and my brethren!</b> 
12:50  <b>For* whoever practices the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother and sister and mother.</b></p>
<h3>Matthew 13</h3>
<p>{Mk 4:1-25 &amp; Mt 13:1-23 &amp; Lk 8:4-18 Sea of Galilee.}</p>
<p>13:1 Now in that day, Jesus went out of the house and was sitting beside the sea. 
13:2 And large crowds were gathered to <i>see</i> him, so-that he stepped onto a ship and sat, and all the crowd stood upon the beach.</p>
<p>13:3 And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying: <b>Behold, the sower went forth to sow;</b> 
13:4 <b>and while* he sowed, some fell beside the road and the birds came and devoured them.</b></p>
<p>13:5 <b>Now others fell upon the rocky-areas, where they did not have much soil and immediately they rose up because they had no depth of soil;</b> 
13:6 <b>and when* the sun rose, they were burnt, and they dried up because they had no root.</b></p>
<p>13:7 <b>Now others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns shot up and choked them.</b></p>
<p>13:8 <b>But now, others fell upon the good soil and were giving fruit, which some <i>was</i> a hundred <i>times</i>, but <i>some</i> was sixty, but <i>some</i> thirty.</b></p>
<p>13:9 <b>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</b></p>
<br>
<p>13:10 And the disciples came and said to him, Why do you speak to them in parables?</p>
<p>13:11 But he answered and said to them, <b>It has been given to you* to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but it has not given to those <i>men</i>.</b> 
13:12 <b>For* who<i>ever</i> has, to him will be given and he will abound, but who<i>ever</i> does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.</b> 
13:13 <b>Because of this, I speak to them in parables, because seeing, they do not see, and hearing, they do not hear, nor do they understand.</b> 
13:14  <b>And the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled upon them, which says, ‘In hearing you* will hear and may never* understand, and seeing you* will see and may never* know;</b> 
13:15 <b>for* the heart of this people has become-callous and they have selectively heard with the ears and they have closed their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes and should hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should turn again and I will heal them.’</b> {Isa 6:9-10} 
13:16 <b>But your* eyes <i>are</i> fortunate, because they are seeing, and your* ears, because they are hearing.</b> 
13:17 <b>For* assuredly I am saying to you*, that many prophets and righteous <i>men</i> desired to see the things you* are seeing and did not see them, and to hear the things you* are hearing and did not hear them</b>.</p>
<br>
<p>13:18 <b>Therefore you*, hear the parable of the sower:</b>  
13:19 <b>everyone hearing the word of the kingdom and not understanding <i>it</i>, <i>then</i> the evil <i>one</i> comes and takes away what has been sown in his heart. This is he who was sown beside the road.</b></p>
<p>13:20 <b>And he who was sown upon the rocky-areas, this is he who hears the word and immediately <i>is</i> receiving it with joy;</b> 
13:21 <b>but he does not have root in himself, but is temporary, and when* affliction or persecution has happened <i>to him</i> because of the word, immediately he stumbles.</b></p>
<p>13:22 <b>And he who was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, and the anxiety of this world and the deception of riches, choke the word and he becomes unfruitful.</b></p>
<p>13:23 <b>Now he who was sown upon the good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it; who bears-fruit and produces some a hundred <i>times</i>, and <i>some</i> sixty, and <i>some</i> thirty!</b></p>
<p>{Mt 13:24-30; no parallel.}</p>
<p>13:24 He placed another parable with them, saying: <b>The kingdom of the heavens is similar to a man who sowed good seed in his field;</b> 
13:25 <b>but while* the men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnels between <i>the stalks</i> of the wheat and went away.</b> 
13:26 <b>But when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then <i>the</i> darnels also appeared.</b> 
13:27 <b>Now the bondservant of the householder came and said to him, Lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? Then* from where have <i>the</i> darnels <i>come</i>?</b></p>
<p>13:28 <b>Now he said to them, A man, an enemy, did this.</b></p>
<p><b>Now the bondservants said to him, Then* do you wish that we go and collect them?</b></p>
<p>13:29 <b>But he said, No; lest <i>while</i> collecting up the darnels, you* may uproot the wheat at the same time with them.</b> 
13:30 <b>Allow both to be grown together till the harvest, and I will say to the reapers in the time of the harvest, Collect first the darnels and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 4:30-34 &amp; Mt 13:31-35.}</p>
<p>13:31 He placed another parable before them, saying: <b>The kingdom of the heavens is similar to a kernel of a mustard-seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;</b> 
13:32 <b>which indeed is least <i>compared to</i> all of the <i>other</i> seeds, but whenever it is grown, it is greater <i>than</i> the herbs and becomes a tree, so-that the birds of the heaven come and nest in its branches.</b></p>
<br>
<p>13:33 He spoke another parable to them: <b>The kingdom of the heavens is similar to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three three-gallon containers of flour, until it was entirely leavened.</b></p>
<br>
<p>13:34 Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds, and he was not speaking to them without a parable; 
13:35 *that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, ‘I will open my mouth in parables. I will utter things which have been hidden from the conception of the world.’ {Psa 78:2}</p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 13:36-53; no parallel.}</p>
<p>13:36 Then Jesus, having left the crowds, went into the house and his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the darnels of the field.</p>
<p>13:37 Now he answered and said to them, <b>He who is sowing the good seed is the Son of Man;</b> 
13:38 <b>and the field is the world, and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, and the darnels are the sons of the evil <i>one</i>;</b> 
13:39 <b>and the enemy that sowed them is the Devil and the harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are messengers.</b> 
13:40 <b>Therefore, just-like the darnels is collected and burned with fire; so it will be in the end of this world.</b> 
13:41 <b>The Son of Man will send forth his messengers and they will collect out of his kingdom all the offenses and those who are practicing lawlessness,</b> 
13:42 <b>and will cast them into the furnace of fire– the weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be there.</b> 
13:43 <b>Then the righteous will shine out like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</b></p>
<br>
<p>13:44 <b>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is similar to a treasure that has been hidden in the field; which a man found and hid, and he goes and sells all <i>his</i> things in his joy, as many things as he has and buys that field.</b></p>
<br>
<p>13:45 <b>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is similar to a man, <i>who is</i> a merchant, seeking beautiful pearls;</b>  
13:46 <b>who found one <i>very</i> precious pearl, went and sold* all <i>his</i> things, as many things as he had, and bought it.</b></p>
<br>
<p>13:47 <b>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is similar to a dragnet, that was cast into the sea and gathered <i>fish</i> of every variety;</b> 
13:48 <b>which, when* it was filled, having hauled it up upon the beach, and having sat down, they collected the good into containers, but they cast the rotten outside.</b> 
13:49 <b>So it will be in the end of the world; the messengers will go out and separate* the evil from the midst of the righteous,</b> 
13:50 <b>and will cast them into the furnace of fire– the weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be there.</b></p>
<br>
<p>13:51 And Jesus says to them, <b>Have you* understood all these things?</b></p>
<p>They say to him, Yes, Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>13:52 Now he said to them, <b>Because of this, every scribe who has been made a disciple to the kingdom of the heavens is similar to a man who is a householder, who casts forth out of his treasure, new and old <i>things</i>.</b></p>
<br>
<p>13:53 And it happened, when Jesus <i>had</i> completed these parables, he took off from there.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 6:1-6a &amp; Mt 13:54-58 Nazareth.}</p>
<p>13:54 And when* he came into his fatherland, he was teaching them in their synagogue, so-that they were astounded and said, From where <i>did</i> this one <i>receive</i> the wisdom and the miracles? 
13:55 Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is his mother not called* Mary? And his brethren, James and Joses and Simon and Jude? 
13:56 And are they not all his sisters with us? Then* from where did this one <i>receive</i> all these things? 
13:57 And they were being offended at him.</p>
<p>But Jesus said to them, <b>A prophet is not without honor, except in his fatherland and in his own house.</b> 
13:58 And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.</p>
<h3>Matthew 14</h3>
<p>{Mk 6:14-29 &amp; Mt 14:1-12 &amp; Lk 9:7-9.}</p>
<p>14:1 Herod the Tetrarch heard the report of Jesus at that time, 
14:2 and said to his young-servants, This is John the Immerser*; he was raised from the dead, and because of this, these powers are working in him. 
14:3 For* Herod had took-hold of John, and bound him, and placed him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.</p>
<p>14:4 For* John said to him, It is not legal for you to have her.</p>
<p>14:5 And wishing to kill him, <i>but</i> he feared the crowd, because they held him as a prophet.</p>
<p>14:6 Now when* Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst <i>of the court</i> and pleased Herod; 
14:7 from where he confessed with an oath to give her whatever she asks <i>of him.</i></p>
<p>14:8 Now being pushed forward by her mother, she says, Give me the head of John the Immerser* upon a platter here.</p>
<p>14:9 And the king was sorrowful, but because of his oaths and of those who reclined <i>at the meal</i> together with him, he commanded it to be given. 
14:10 And he sent and beheaded John in the prison. 
14:11 And his head was carried upon a platter, and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. 
14:12 And his disciples came and lifted up the body, and buried it, and they went and reported to Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 6:30-32 &amp; Mt 
14:13 &amp; Lk 
9:10 &amp; Jn 
6:1 East shore of Galilee.}</p>
<p>14:13 And when* Jesus heard <i>it</i>, he departed from there in a ship, privately to a desolate place, and when* the crowds heard <i>of it,</i> they followed him on foot from the cities.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 6:33-44 &amp; Mt 14:14-21 &amp; Lk 9:11-17 &amp; Jn 6:2-14.}</p>
<p>14:14 And when* Jesus went out, he saw a large crowd, and he had compassion on <i>them</i> and healed their sick. 
14:15 Now when* it became evening, his disciples came to him, saying, The place is desolate and the hour has already passed away; dismiss the crowds, that* they may go away into the villages and buy food for themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>14:16 But Jesus said to them, <b>They have no need to go away; you*, give them <i>food</i> to eat!</b></p>
<p>14:17 But they say to him, We do not have <i>anything</i> here except five loaves and two fish.</p>
<p>14:18 Now he said, <b>Bring them here to me.</b> 
14:19 And he commanded the crowds to recline upon the grass, and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave-thanks and broke <i>them</i>, and he gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples <i>then gave</i> to the crowds. 
14:20 And they all ate and were fed, and they took up what was leftover of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full. 
14:21 Now those eating were approximately five thousand <i>men</i>, plus women and children.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 6:45-56 &amp; Mt 14:22-36 &amp; Jn 6:15-21.}</p>
<p>14:22 And immediately, Jesus urged the disciples to step into the ship, and to precede him to the <i>area</i> beyond-that, until he should dismiss the crowds. 
14:23 And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up into the mountain privately to pray. Now when* it became evening, he was alone there. 
14:24 But the ship was already in the midst of the sea, was being tormented by the waves; for* the wind was adverse. 
14:25 Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking upon the sea. 
14:26 And when* the disciples saw him walking upon the sea, they were disturbed, saying, It is an apparition, and they cried out from <i>their</i> fear.</p>
<p>14:27 But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, <b>Have courage; it is I; do not be afraid.</b></p>
<p>14:28 Now Peter having answered to him, said, Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you upon the waters.</p>
<p>14:29 Now he said, <b>Come.</b></p>
<p>And Peter went down from the ship, and walked upon the waters to go toward Jesus. 
14:30 But he was afraid, seeing the strong wind, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.</p>
<p>14:31 Now Jesus immediately stretched out his hand, and grabbed him, and says to him, <b>You of small faith, why were you skeptical?</b></p>
<p>14:32 And when* they stepped into the ship, the wind pauses. 
14:33 Now those in the ship, having come <i>to him</i>, worshiped him, saying, You are truly the Son of God.</p>
<br>
<p>14:34 And having ferried over, they came to the land <i>of</i> Gennesaret. 
14:35 And when* the men of that place recognized him, they sent <i>word</i> into the whole region around and brought to him all those who have an ill<i>ness</i>, 
14:36 and they were pleading with him that* they might only touch the hem of his garment and as many as touched <i>it,</i> were cured.</p>
<h3>Matthew 15</h3>
<p>{Mk 7:1-23 &amp; Mt 15:1-20 &amp; Jn 
7:1 Galilee, probably Capernaum Spring 29 AD.}</p>
<p>15:1 Then the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem come to Jesus, saying, 
15:2 Why are your disciples transgressing the tradition of the elders? For* they do not wash their hands whenever they eat bread.</p>
<p>15:3 But he answered and said to them, <b>Why do you* also transgress the commandment of God because of your* tradition?</b> 
15:4 <b>For* God commanded, saying, ‘Honor <i>your</i> father and <i>your</i> mother.’</b> {Ex. 
20:12 &amp; Deu. 5:16} <b>And, ‘He who is speaking evil of <i>their</i> father or mother, let him be ended <i>by the sentence of</i> death.’</b>  {Ex. 
21:17 &amp; Lev. 20:9} 
15:5 <b>But you* say, Whoever says to his father or his mother, <i>in</i> whatever you might have been profited from me, <i>it is</i> a gift <i>to God</i>,</b> 
15:6 <b>and <i>then</i> should never* honor his father and mother, and <i>thus</i> you* invalidated the commandment of God because of your* tradition.</b> 
15:7 <b>You* hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied well concerning you*, saying,</b> 
15:8 ‘<b>These people are drawing near to me with their mouth, and are honoring me with their lips, but their heart is faraway from me.</b> 
15:9 <b>But they are worshiping me in futility, teaching <i>as their</i> teachings– the commandments of men.’</b> {Isa 29:13}</p>
<p>15:10 And he called to him the crowd and said to them, <b>Hear and understand!</b> 
15:11 <b>Not what enters into the mouth desecrates the man, but what is traveling from the mouth, this desecrates the man.</b></p>
<br>
<p>15:12 Then the disciples, having come to <i>him</i>, said, Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when* they heard this speech?</p>
<p>15:13 He answered and said, <b>Every plant which my heavenly father did not plant will be uprooted.</b> 
15:14 <b>Leave them! They are blind guides of the blind. Now if the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a ditch.</b></p>
<p>15:15 Now Peter answered and said to him, Explain to us the parable.</p>
<p>15:16 Now Jesus said, <b>Are you* also without understanding at this point?</b> 
15:17 <b>Are you* not yet perceiving, that whatever travels into the mouth makes room in the belly, and is cast out into the sewer?</b> 
15:18 <b>But these things which are traveling from the mouth, come out from the heart, and they desecrate the man.</b> 
15:19 <b>For* out of the heart comes forth evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.</b> 
15:20  <b>These are the things which desecrate the man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not desecrate the man.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 
7:24 &amp; Mt 15:21.}</p>
<p>15:21 And Jesus went out from there, and departed into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 7:25-30 &amp; Mt 15:22-28 Tyre and Sidon.}</p>
<p>15:22 And behold, a woman from Canaan came out from those borders, and cried-out to him, saying, Show-mercy to me, O Lord, you <i>the</i> son of David. My daughter is evilly demon-possessed. 
15:23 But he answered her not a word.</p>
<p>And his disciples came and asked him, saying, Dismiss her, because she is crying behind us.</p>
<p>15:24 But he answered and said, <b>I was not sent, except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</b></p>
<p>15:25 But she came and worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me.</p>
<p>15:26 Now he answered and said, <b>It is not good to take the children’s bread and cast it to the puppies.</b></p>
<p>15:27 But she said, Yes, Lord; for* even the puppies eat from the crumbs which are falling from the table of their lords.</p>
<p>15:28 Then Jesus answered and said to her, <b>O woman, great is your faith. Let it happen for you as you will <i>it</i>.</b>  And her daughter was healed from that hour.</p>

<p>{Mk 
7:31 &amp; Mt

<p>15:29 And Jesus, having proceeded from there, went beside the sea of Galilee, and he went up into the mountain and was sitting there.</p>
<p>{Mk 7:32-37 &amp; Mt 15:30-31 Magadan and Bethsaida Summer 29 AD.}</p>
<p>15:30 And large crowds came to him there, having the lame, blind, mute, crippled and many others with them. They tossed them beside the feet of Jesus, and he healed them; 
15:31 so-that the crowds marveled, seeing the mute speaking; the crippled healthy; the lame walking; and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 8:1-
8:9 &amp; Mt 15:32-38.}</p>
<p>15:32 Now Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, <b>I have compassion upon the crowd because they already remain with me three days, and do not have anything <i>that</i> they might eat, and I am not willing to dismiss them starving, lest they might faint on the road.</b></p>
<p>15:33 And his disciples say to him, From where <i>can we buy</i> so-many loaves for us in the wilderness, so-then to feed so-great a crowd?</p>
<p>15:34 And Jesus said to them, <b>How many loaves do you* have?</b></p>
<p>But they said, Seven and a few small-fish.</p>
<p>15:35 And he commanded the crowd to lean-back upon the soil. 
15:36 And he took the seven loaves and the <i>few</i> fish, and he gave-thanks and broke <i>them</i>, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples <i>gave</i> to the crowds. 
15:37 And they all ate and were fed, and they took up what was leftover of the broken pieces, seven baskets full. 
15:38 Now those eating were <i>approximately</i> four thousand men, plus women and children.</p>

<h3>Matthew 16</h3>
<p>16:1 And having come <i>to him</i>, the Pharisees and Sadducees testing <i>him</i>, asked him to show them a sign from heaven. 
16:2 But having answered, he said to them, <b>When* it becomes evening, you* say, <i>It will be</i> fair-weather; for* the heaven is red.</b> 
16:3 <b>And in the morning, <i>There will be</i> a storm today; for* the heaven is red and dismal. Hypocrites! You* indeed know how to discern the face of the heaven, but you* are not able <i>to discern</i> the signs of the times.</b> 
16:4 <b>An evil and adulterous generation is seeking after a sign, and no sign will be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet.</b> And he left them and went away.</p>
<br>
<p>16:5 And his disciples came to the <i>area</i> beyond-that, and forgot to take bread. 
16:6 Now Jesus said to them, <b>Behold and take-heed <i>of things</i> from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!</b></p>
<p>16:7 Now they were reasoning among themselves, saying, <i>It is</i> because we took no bread.</p>
<p>16:8 Now Jesus having known it, said to them, <b>You* of small faith, why are you* reasoning among yourselves, because you* took no bread?</b> 
16:9 <b>Do you* not yet perceive, nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you* took up?</b> 
16:10  <b>Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you* took up?</b> 
16:11 <b>How is it that you* do not perceive that I did not speak to you* concerning bread, <i>but</i> to take-heed <i>of things</i> from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?</b> 
16:12 Then they understood that he did not say to take-heed <i>of things</i> from the leaven of bread, but <i>of things</i> from the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 8:27-30 &amp; Mt 16:13-20 &amp; Lk 9:18-21 Caesarea Philippi.}</p>
<p>16:13 Now when* Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, <b>Who do men say the Son of Man is?</b></p>
<p>16:14 Now they said, Some <i>say</i> John the Immerser*; others, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.</p>
<p>16:15 He says to them, <b>But who do you* say that I am?</b></p>
<p>16:16 Now Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</p>
<p>16:17 And Jesus answered and said to him, <b>You are fortunate, Simon, Son of Jonah, because flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</b> 
16:18 <b>But I also say to you, that you are</b> {F} <b>Peter and upon this,</b> {F} <b>the rock, I will build my</b> {F}  <b>congregation* <i>of believers</i>, and the gates of Hades will not prevail <i>against</i> her.</b> 
16:19 <b>I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind upon the earth will be, having <i>already</i> been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose upon the earth will be, having <i>already</i> been loosed in the heavens.</b> 
16:20 Then he ordered the disciples that* they should tell no one that he was Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 8:31-
9:1 &amp; Mt 16:21-28 &amp; Lk 9:22-27 Caesarea Philippi.}</p>
<p>16:21 Jesus began to show to his disciples from then <i>on</i>, that it is essential <i>for</i> him to go to Jerusalem and to suffer many things from the elders and high-priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to arise in the third day. 
16:22 And Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying, <i>God will be</i> lenient to you, Lord. This will never* be <i>happening</i> to you.</p>
<p>16:23 But he turned and said to Peter, <b>Go behind me, adversary! You are an offense to me, because you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.</b></p>
<p>16:24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, <b>If anyone is willing to come after me, let him deny himself and lift up his cross and follow me.</b> 
16:25 <b>For* whoever wishes to save his life, will lose it, and whoever loses his life because of me will find it.</b> 
16:26 <b>For* what is a man profited, if he gains the whole world, and should forfeit his soul? Or what shall a man give <i>as</i> an exchange for his soul?</b> 
16:27 <b>For* the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his messengers, and then he will give to each one according to his practice.</b> 
16:28 <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, Some of those who are standing here may never* taste of death, until they should see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Footnotes: Mt 16:18, these words are different in Greek. Peter translated is a ‘pebble’ and the other word is ‘rock’ as in ‘a massive rock or rock foundation,’ the kind of rock that the wise man built his house on in Mt 7:24-25, i.e., congregated believers, Eph 4:1-6; discussed more in the ‘Definitions’ section.}</p>
<h3>Matthew 17</h3>
<p>{Mk 9:2-13 &amp; Mt 17:1-13 &amp; Lk 9:28-36 Caesarea Philippi.}</p>
<p>17:1 And after six days Jesus takes with <i>him</i> Peter and James and John his brother, and privately brings them up into a high mountain. 
17:2 And he was transfigured before them, and his face shined like the sun, and his garments became white like the light. 
17:3 And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, speaking together with him.</p>
<p>17:4 Now Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you will <i>it.</i> Should we make* three tabernacles here; one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah?</p>
<p>17:5 <i>While he is</i> still speaking, behold, a radiant cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, <b>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am delighted; hear him!</b></p>
<p>17:6 And when* the disciples heard it, they fell upon their face, and were extremely afraid. 
17:7 And Jesus came and touched them and said, <b>Arise and do not be afraid.</b> 
17:8 Now they saw no one, having lifting up their eyes, except Jesus only.</p>
<p>17:9 And <i>while</i> coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, <b>Tell the vision to no one, until the Son of Man should rise* from the dead.</b></p>
<p>17:10 And his disciples asked him, saying, Then* why do the scribes say that it is essential <i>for</i> Elijah to come first?</p>
<p>17:11 Now Jesus answered and said to them, <b>Indeed Elijah comes first and will restore all things.</b> 
17:12 <b>But I am saying to you*, that Elijah already came, and they did not recognize him, but did as many things as they wished to him. So the Son of Man is also about to suffer by them.</b> 
17:13 Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them concerning John the Immerser*.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 9:14-29 &amp; Mt 17:14-21 &amp; Lk 9:37-43 Region of Caesarea Philippi.}</p>
<p>17:14 And having come to the crowd, a man came to him, kneeling <i>down to</i> him, and saying, 
17:15 Lord, show-mercy to my son, because he is epileptic, and suffers evilly; for* he often falls into the fire and often into the water. 
17:16 And I brought him to your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.</p>
<p>17:17 But Jesus answered and said, <b>O unbelieving and perverse generation, until when shall I be with you*? Until when shall I tolerate you*? Bring him here to me.</b> 
17:18 And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon went out of him, and the boy was healed from that hour.</p>
<p>17:19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, Why were we not able to cast it out?</p>
<p>17:20 Now Jesus said to them, <b>Because of your* unbelief. For* assuredly I am saying to you*, If you* have faith like a kernel of a mustard-seed, you* will say to this mountain, Proceed from here to <i>over</i> there, and it will proceed, and nothing will be impossible for you*.</b> 
17:21 <b>But this variety <i>of demon</i> does not travel out except in prayer and fasting.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 9:30-32 &amp; Mt 17:22-23 &amp; Lk 9:43-45 Return to Galilee.}</p>
<p>17:22 Now <i>while</i> conducting <i>work</i> in Galilee, Jesus said to them, <b>The Son of Man is about to be given up into the hands of men;</b> 
17:23 <b>and they will kill him, and he will be arisen in the third day.</b> And they were extremely sorrowful.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 17:24-27 Capernaum Sept. 29 AD; no parallel.}</p>
<p>17:24 Now having come to Capernaum, those who receive the four-denarii <i>tax</i> came to Peter and said, Does your* teacher not pay the four-denarii <i>tax</i>?</p>
<p>17:25 He says, Yes.</p>
<p>And when he entered into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, <b>What do you think, Simon? The kings of the earth, from whom do they receive taxes or tribute? From their sons or from the aliens?</b></p>
<p>17:26 And Peter says to him, From aliens.</p>
<p>Jesus said to him, <b>Consequently*, the sons are free.</b>  
17:27 <b>But in order that we might not offend them, you travel to the sea and cast a fishhook, and lift <i>out</i> the fish that ascends first, and when* you have opened its mouth, you will find a four-denarii coin. Take that, and give <i>it</i> to them in exchange-for you and me.</b></p>
<h3>Matthew 18</h3>
<p>{Mk 9:33-50 &amp; Mt 18:1-14 &amp; Lk 9:46-50 Sept. 29 AD.}</p>
<p>18:1 The disciples came to Jesus in that hour, saying, Who then is greater in the kingdom of the heavens?</p>
<p>18:2 And Jesus, having called to <i>him</i> a little child, stood it in the midst of them, 
18:3 and said, <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, If you* do not turn and become like little children, you* may never* enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</b> 
18:4 <b>Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child, this one is the greater one in the kingdom of the heavens.</b> 
18:5 <b>And whoever accepts one such child in my name, accepts me.</b> 
18:6 <b>But whoever offends one of these little ones who believes in me, it is <i>more</i> advantageous for him that* a millstone, <i>the ones</i> rotated by a donkey, should be hung on his neck, and <i>that*</i> he should be sunk in the depths of the sea.</b></p>
<p>18:7 <b>Woe to the world from the <i>coming</i> offenses! For* it is a necessity <i>for</i> the offenses to come; however, woe to that man through whom the offense comes!</b> 
18:8 <b>Now if your hand or your foot is offending you, cut <i>both of</i> them off and cast <i>them</i> from you. It is good for you to enter into life lame or crippled, <i>rather</i> than to be cast into the everlasting fire, having two hands or two feet.</b>  
18:9 <b>And if your eye is offending you, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is good for you to enter into life one-eyed, <i>rather</i> than having two eyes, <i>and</i> to be cast into the hell of fire.</b></p>
<p>18:10 <b>See that you* do not despise one of these little ones; for* I say to you*, that in the heavens their messengers are always looking at the face of my Father who is in the heavens.</b> 
18:11 <b>For* the Son of Man came to save what has been lost.</b></p>
<p>{Similar: Mt 18:12-14, Lk 15:3-7}</p>
<p>18:12 <b>What are you* thinking? If there should happen to <i>be</i> any man <i>who has</i> a hundred sheep, and one out of them might be misled, does he not leave the ninety nine and travel on the mountains, and seek the one that is misled?</b> 
18:13 <b>And if he happens to find it, assuredly I am saying to you*, He rejoices over it more than over the ninety nine which have not been misled.</b>  
18:14 <b>So it is also not the will before your* Father who is in heaven, that* one of these little ones should perish.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 18:15-35; no parallel.}</p>
<p>18:15 <b>Now if your brother sins against</b> {Greek: toward}  <b>you, go and reprove him, <i>the sin is</i> between you and him only; if he hears you, you have gained your brother.</b> 
18:16 <b>But if he does not hear <i>you</i>, take with you one or two more, that*, ‘at the mouth of two or three witnesses every declaration should be established.’</b>  {Deu. 19:15} 
18:17 <b>But if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the congregation*, and if he also refuses to hear the congregation*, let him be just-like the Gentile and the tax collector to you.</b></p>
<p>18:18 <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, As many things as you* may bind upon the earth will be, having <i>already</i> been bound in heaven, and as many things as you* may loose upon earth will be, having <i>already</i> been loosed in heaven.</b> 
18:19 <b>Again I say to you*, that if two of you* agree together upon the earth concerning any matter, whatever they ask, it will happen for them from my Father who <i>is</i> in <i>the</i> heavens.</b> 
18:20 <b>For* where two or three have been gathered together in my name, I am there in the midst of them.</b></p>
<br>
<p>18:21 Then Peter having come near to him, said, Lord, how-often will my brother sin against {Greek: toward} me and I forgive him? Until seven-times?</p>
<p>18:22 Jesus says to him, <b>I do not say to you, Until seven times, but, until seventy-times seven-times.</b> 
18:23  <b>Because of this, the kingdom of the heavens has been similar to a certain king who wished to settle <i>the</i> account with his bondservants.</b> 
18:24 <b>Now having begun to settle <i>the account</i>, one <i>man</i> was brought to him, a debtor of ten-thousand <i>silver</i> talants</b> {$10 billion total}<b>.</b>  
18:25 <b>But he did not have <i>anything</i> to repay <i>him with</i>, <i>so</i> his lord commanded him and his wife and children and all things, as many things as he was holding, to be sold* and <i>the money</i> to be repaid <i>to him</i>.</b></p>
<p>18:26 <b>Then* the bondservant falling down, was worshiping him, saying, Lord, have patience upon me, and I will repay all <i>of it</i> to you.</b> 
18:27 <b>But the lord of that bondservant, having compassion on <i>him</i>, released him and forgave him the loan.</b></p>
<p>18:28 <b>But that bondservant went out and found one of his fellow bondservants who owed him a hundred denarii, and he took-hold of him, and was choking <i>him</i>, saying, Repay if you are owing me anything.</b></p>
<p>18:29 <b>Then* his fellow bondservant, falling down at his feet, was pleading with him, saying, Have patience upon me and I will repay you.</b> 
18:30 <b>But he did not wish to, but went and cast him into prison, until he should repay what is owed.</b> 
18:31 <b>But his fellow bondservants, having seen the things that had happened, were extremely sorrowful. And having come to their own lord, they told all the things that <i>had</i> happened.</b></p>
<p>18:32 <b>Then his lord called him, and says to him, You evil bondservant, I forgave you all that debt, since you pleaded with me.</b> 
18:33 <b>It was essential <i>for</i> you to have shown-mercy also on your fellow bondservant, like I also had shown-mercy to you.</b> 
18:34 <b>And his lord, was angry and gave him to the torturers until he should repay everything that is owed <i>to</i> him.</b> 
18:35 <b>So my heavenly Father will also do to you*, if each of you* does not forgive his brother his trespasses from your* hearts.</b></p>
<h3>Matthew 19</h3>
<p>{Mk 10:1-12 &amp; Mt 19:1-12.}</p>
<p>19:1 And it happened, when Jesus <i>had</i> completed these words, he took off from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond-that of the Jordan; 
19:2 and large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.</p>
<br>
<p>19:3 And the Pharisees came to him, testing him and saying to him, If it is legal to a man to divorce his wife according to every cause.</p>
<p>19:4 But he answered and said to them, <b>Have you* not read, He who made* <i>them</i>, made* them male and female from the beginning.</b> {Gen. 1:27, 5:2} 
19:5 And said, <b>Because of this, a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will be <i>jointed</i> into one flesh.</b> {Gen. 2:24} 
19:6 <b>So-that they are no more two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has yoked together; let man not separate.</b></p>
<p>19:7 They say to him, Then* why did Moses command <i>us</i> to give a document of divorcement and to dismiss <i>her</i>? {Deu. 24:1-4}</p>
<p>19:8 He says to them, <b>Moses permitted you* to divorce your* wives for your* hardness of heart, but from the beginning it has not become so.</b> 
19:9 <b>But I am saying to you*, Whoever divorces his wife not over</b> {Greek: upon. Or: upon <i>the basis of</i>} <b>fornication, and should marry another, is committing adultery, and he who marries her who has been divorced is committing adultery.</b> {Mt 5:32, Lk 16:18}</p>
<p>19:10 His disciples say to him, If thus is the case of the man with his wife, it is not advantageous to marry.</p>
<p>19:11 But he said to them, <b>Not all <i>people will</i> make room for this word, but <i>they</i> to whom it has been given:</b> 
19:12 <b>for* there are eunuchs who were born so out of their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. He who is able to make room for it, let him make room for it.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 10:13-16 &amp; Mt 19:13-15 &amp; Lk 18:15-17 Peraea.}</p>
<p>19:13 Then little children were brought to him, that* he might lay his hands on them and might pray <i>for them</i>, and the disciples rebuked them. 
19:14 But Jesus said, <b>Allow the little children, and do not forbid them to come to me; for* of such is the kingdom of the heavens.</b> 
19:15 And having laid his hands on them, he traveled from there.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 10:17-31 &amp; Mt 19:16-
20:16 &amp; Lk 18:18-30 Peraea.}</p>
<p>19:16 And behold, one <i>man</i> came to <i>him</i> and said to him, Good teacher, what good <i>things</i> should I practice that* I may have everlasting life?</p>
<p>19:17 Now he said to him, <b>Why do you call* me good? No one is good except one– God, but if you wish to enter into <i>everlasting</i> life, keep the commandments.</b></p>
<p>19:18 He says to him, What <i>ones</i>?</p>
<p>Now Jesus said, <b>Do not murder; Do not commit adultery; Do not steal; Do not falsely testify,</b> 
19:19  <b>Honor <i>your</i> father and mother.</b> {Ex. 20:12-16 &amp; Deu. 5:16-20} <b>And, You will love* your neighbor like yourself.</b> {Lev. 19:18}</p>
<p>19:20 The young-man says to him, I have observed all these things from my youth. So what am I still lacking?</p>
<p>19:21 Jesus said to him, <b>If you are willing to be complete, go, sell your possessions and give to <i>the</i> poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come-here. Follow me.</b> 
19:22 But when* the young-man heard the word, he went away <i>and</i> was sorrowing; for* he had many properties.</p>
<br>
<p>19:23 Now Jesus said to his disciples, <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, A rich man will hardly enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</b> 
19:24 <b>But again I am saying to you*, It is easier <i>for</i> a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than <i>for</i> a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</b></p>
<p>19:25 Now when* his disciples heard it, they were being extremely astounded, saying, Who then is able to be saved?</p>
<p>19:26 But Jesus, looked at <i>them</i> and said to them, <b>This is impossible with men, but all things are possible with God.</b></p>
<p>19:27 Then Peter answered and said to him, Behold, we have left all and followed you; what then will be <i>left</i> for us?</p>
<p>19:28 But Jesus said to them, <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, that you* who have followed me, whenever the Son of Man sits upon <i>the</i> throne of his glory in the rebirth, you* will also sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</b> 
19:29 <b>And everyone who has left houses or brethren or sisters, or <i>their</i> father or mother or wife, or children or fields, because of my name, will receive a hundred-times <i>that</i>, and will inherit everlasting life.</b> 
19:30 <b>But many will be last <i>who are</i> first, and first <i>who are</i> last.</b></p>

<h3>Matthew 20</h3>
<p>20:1 <b>For* the kingdom of the heavens is similar to a man who was a householder, who went out at the same time <i>every</i> morning to hire workers into his vineyard.</b> 
20:2 <b>And having agreed together with the workers for a denarius a day</b> {a standard day’s pay}<b>, he sent them into his vineyard.</b> 
20:3 <b>And he went out around the third hour</b> {i.e. 
9:00 AM} <b>and saw others standing idle in the marketplace;</b> 
20:4 <b>and he said to those <i>men</i>, You* also, go into the vineyard and I will give you* whatever is just. And they went.</b> 
20:5 <b>Again, they went out around the sixth</b> {i.e. Noon} <b>and the ninth hour;</b> {i.e. 
3:00 PM} <b>and he did likewise*.</b> 
20:6 <b>Now around the eleventh hour,</b> {i.e. 
5:00 PM} <b>he went out and found others standing idle, and he says to them, Why are you* standing here idle the whole day?</b></p>
<p>20:7 <b>They say to him, Because no one has hired us.</b></p>
<p><b><i>So</i> he says to them, You* also, go into the vineyard and I will give you* whatever is just.</b> 
20:8 <b>Now when* it became evening, the lord of the vineyard says to his commissioner, Call the workers and give to them their wages, begin from the last to the first.</b> 
20:9 <b>And when* those <i>hired</i> around the eleventh hour</b> {i.e. 
5:00 PM}  <b>came, they <i>each</i> received a denarius apiece.</b> 
20:10 <b>Now when* the first came, they supposed that they will receive more, but they themselves also received a denarius apiece.</b></p>
<p>20:11 <b>But having received it, they were murmuring against the householder,</b> 
20:12 <b>saying, These last ones have <i>only</i> done one hour <i>of work</i>, and you have made* them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the burning heat.</b></p>
<p>20:13 <b>But he answered and said to one of them, Comrade, I am not wronging you. Did you not agree together with me for a denarius?</b> 
20:14 <b>Take up what <i>is</i> yours and go away. It is my will to give to this last <i>one</i>, as <i>I</i> also <i>did</i> to you.</b> 
20:15 <b>Or is it not legal for me to do what I will in what <i>is</i> mine? <i>Or</i> is your eye evil, because I am good?</b>

20:19 <b>and they will give him to the Gentiles, *that* they should mock and scourge and crucify <i>him</i>, and in the third day he will rise* again.</b></p>
<br>
<p>20:20 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, came to him, worshiping <i>him</i>, and asking something from him. 
20:21 But he said to her, <b>What do you wish?</b></p>
<p>She says to him, Say that* these, my two sons, may sit, one at your right <i>hand</i> and one at your left <i>hand</i> in your kingdom<b>.</b></p>
<p>20:22 But Jesus answered and said, <b>You* do not know what you* ask. Are you* able to drink the cup which I am about to drink, and to be immersed* <i>with</i> the immersion* <i>to</i> which I am <i>about to be</i> immersed*?</b></p>
<p>They say to him, We are able<b>.</b></p>
<p>20:23 And he says to them, <b>Indeed, you* will drink my cup and you* will be immersed* <i>with</i> the immersion* <i>to</i> which I am immersed*, but to sit at my right and at my left, is not mine to give, but <i>it is for them</i> for whom it has been prepared by my Father.</b> 
20:24 And having heard <i>this</i>, they were indignant concerning the two brothers.</p>
<p>20:25 But Jesus called them and said, <b>You* know that the rulers of the Gentiles are lording it over them, and their great ones wield authority over them.</b> 
20:26 <b>But it will not be so among you*, but whoever wishes to become great among you*, he will be your* servant;</b>  
20:27 <b>and whoever wishes to be first among you*, let him be your* bondservant;</b> 
20:28 <b>just-like the Son of Man did not come to be served to, but to serve and to give his life <i>as</i> a redemption in exchange-for many.</b></p>

20:30 And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, having heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, saying, Lord, son of David, show-mercy to us! 
20:31 But the crowd rebuked them, that* they should be silent, but they were crying out the greatest, saying, Lord, son of David, show-mercy <i>to</i> us!</p>
<p>20:32 And Jesus stood and summoned them, and said, <b>What do you* will that I might do for you*?</b></p>

<p>21:1 And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, toward the Mountain of Olives, Jesus then sent two disciples, 
21:2 saying to them, <b>Travel into the village which is in front of you*, and immediately you* will find a donkey that has been tied and a colt with her. Loose <i>them</i> and lead <i>them</i> to me.</b> 
21:3 <b>And if anyone says anything to you*, You* will say, The Lord has need of them, and immediately he will send them.</b> 
21:4 Now this whole thing has happened, in order that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, 
21:5 ‘Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King is coming to you, meek and has <i>been</i> mounted upon a donkey and a colt, the son of a donkey.’ {Isa 
62:11 &amp; Zech. 9:9} 
21:6 Now the disciples having traveled and having done just-as Jesus commanded them, 
21:7 they led the donkey and the colt and placed their garments upon them, and he sat upon them. 
21:8 But most of the crowd spread their garments in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road.</p>
<p>21:9 Now the crowds that precede him and who are following <i>him</i>, were crying, saying, ‘Hosanna to the son of David. He who is coming in the name of the Lord has been blessed.’ Hosanna in the highest.’ {Psa 118:25-26} 
21:10 And having come into Jerusalem, all the city was shaken <i>up</i>, saying, Who is this?</p>
<p>21:11 But the crowds were saying, This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.</p>

<p>21:12 And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all those who are selling and buying in the temple, and turned over the tables of the brokers and the chairs of those selling the doves; 
21:13 and he says to them, It has been written, <b>My house will be called a house of prayer, but you* made* it a den of robbers.</b> {Isa 
56:7 &amp; Jer. 7:11}</p>
<p>21:14 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. 
21:15 But when* the high-priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things that he did, and the children crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David.</p>
<p>They were indignant, 
21:16 and said to him, Do you hear what they are saying?</p>
<p>But Jesus says to them, <b>Yes. Have you* never* read, ‘You have matured praise out of the mouth of infants and nursing <i>babies</i>.’</b> {Psa 8:2} 
21:17 And he left them, and went forth outside the city to Bethany, and camped there.</p>
<br>
<p>21:18 Now in the morning, <i>as he was</i> leading <i>them</i> back to the city, he hungered. 
21:19 And seeing a fig tree upon the road, he came upon it and found nothing in it, except leaves only, and he says to it, <b>Let it happen <i>that there is</i> no fruit from you <i>any</i> longer, forever.</b> And instantly the fig tree dried up.</p>

<p>21:20 And when* the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How did the fig tree instantly dry up?</p>
<p>21:21 Now Jesus answered and said to them, <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, If you* have faith and do not doubt, you* will not only do the <i>miracle</i> of the fig tree, but even if you* say to this mountain, Be lifted up and cast <i>yourself</i> into the sea, it will happen.</b>

<p>21:24 But Jesus answered and said to them, <b>I will also ask you* one question, which if you* tell me, then I will also tell you* by what authority I am doing these things.</b> 
21:25 <b>The immersion* of John, where was it <i>from</i>, from heaven or from men?</b></p>
<p>Now they were reasoning with themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven; he will say to us, Then* why did you* not believe him? 
21:26 But if we say, From men; we fear the crowd; for* all hold John as a prophet. 
21:27 And they answered Jesus and said, We do not know.</p>
<p>He also said to them, <b>Nor do I tell you* by what authority I am doing these things.</b></p>

21:34 <b>Now when the time of the fruits drew near, he sent his bondservants to the farmers, to receive his fruits.</b> 
21:35 <b>And then the farmers took his bondservants and whipped one, and killed one and stoned one.</b> 
21:36 <b>Again, he sent other bondservants, more-than the first, and they did to them likewise*.</b> 
21:37  <b>But later he sent to them his son, saying, They will revere my son.</b> 
21:38 <b>But the farmers, when* they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir. Come-here. We should kill him, and we might hold-onto his inheritance.</b> 
21:39 <b>And they took him and cast him forth outside the vineyard, and killed him.</b> 
21:40  <b>Therefore, whenever the lord of the vineyard comes, what shall he do to those farmers?</b></p>
<p>21:41 They say to him, He will evilly destroy those evil men, and will rent the vineyard to other farmers, who will give to him the fruits at their seasons.</p>
<p>21:42 Jesus says to them, <b>Have you* never* read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected*, this has become the head of the corner; this has become from the Lord and it is marvelous in our eyes?</b> {Psa 118:22-23} 
21:43 <b>Because of this, I am saying to you*, The kingdom of God will be taken away from you*, and will be given to a nation producing the fruits of it.</b>

<p>22:1 And Jesus answered and spoke again to them in parables, saying: 
22:2 <b>The kingdom of the heavens is similar to a certain king, who made* a marriage feast for his son,</b> 
22:3 <b>and sent forth his bondservants to call to those who have been invited to the marriage feast, and they were not willing to come.</b> 
22:4 Again he sent forth other bondservants, saying, Tell those who have been invited, Behold, I prepared my meal; my oxen and my fattened calves have been sacrificed, and all things are prepared. Come-here to the marriage feast. 
22:5 <b>But they neglecting it, went away, one to his own field, another to his merchandise;</b> 
22:6 <b>and the rest took-hold of his bondservants, and abused them and killed them.</b> 
22:7  <b>And that king, having heard <i>it</i>, was angry, and he having sent his armies, destroyed those murderers and incinerated their city.</b></p>
<p>22:8 <b>Then he says to his bondservants, The wedding is prepared, but those who have been invited were not worthy.</b> 
22:9 <b>Therefore, travel on the thoroughfares of the roads, and as many as you* may find, invite to the marriage feast.</b> 
22:10 <b>And those bondservants, having gone out into the roads, gathered together all things, as many <i>people</i> as they found, both evil and good and the wedding was filled <i>with people</i> reclining <i>at the table</i>.</b></p>
<p>22:11 <b>But when* the king came in to look at those reclining <i>at the table</i>, he saw a man there who has not clothed himself in wedding attire;</b>

22:13 <b>Then the king said to the servants, When* you* bind him hand and foot, take him away and cast <i>him</i> out into the outer darkness– the weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be there.</b>

<p>22:15 Then the Pharisees traveled <i>away</i> and took counsel <i>on</i> how they might ensnare him in <i>his</i> words. 
22:16 And they send their disciples to him, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God in truth, and do not care concerning anyone<i>’s appearance</i>; for* you do not look at <i>the</i> countenance of men. 
22:17 Therefore tell us, What do you think? Is it legal to give tribute to Caesar or not?</p>
<p>22:18 But Jesus, having known their wickedness, said, <b>Why are you* testing me, you* hypocrites?</b> 
22:19 <b>Show me the tribute coin.</b> Now they brought to him a denarius. 
22:20 And he says to them, <b>Whose <i>face</i> is this image and inscription?</b> 
22:21 They say to him, Caesar’s. Then he says to them, <b>Therefore give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God, the things that are God’s.</b>

<p>{Mk 12:18-27 &amp; Mt 22:23-33 &amp; Lk 20:27-39.}</p>
<p>22:23 In that day, <i>the</i> Sadducees came to him, saying that there is no resurrection, and they asked him, 
22:24 saying, Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies, having no children, his brother will marry his wife and will raise* up seed to his brother. {Deu. 25:5} 
22:25 Now seven brethren were with us, and the first having married, <i>but after</i> he was dead*, his wife had no seed left to his brother; 
22:26 likewise also the second and the third, to the seventh. 
22:27 But after <i>them</i> all, the woman also died. 
22:28 Therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven in the resurrection? For* they all had her <i>as a wife</i>.</p>
<p>22:29 But Jesus answered and said to them, <b>You* are being misled, <i>by</i> not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</b> 
22:30 <b>For* in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are betrothed, but are like messengers of God in heaven.</b> 
22:31 <b>But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you* not read what was spoken to you* by God, saying,</b> 
22:32 <b>I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?</b> {Ex. 3:6} <b>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</b> 
22:33 And when* the crowds heard it, they were being astounded at his teaching.</p>

<p>22:34 But the Pharisees, having heard that he had hushed the Sadducees, were gathered together on the same <i>ground</i>. 
22:35 And one out of them, a professor of the law, asked <i>a question</i>, testing him and saying, 
22:36 Teacher, what is the great commandment in the law?</p>
<br>
<p>22:37 Now Jesus said to him, <b>You will love* the Lord your God in your whole heart and in your whole soul and in your whole mind.</b> {Deu. 6:5} 
22:38 <b>This is <i>the</i> first and <i>the</i> great commandment.</b> 
22:39 <b>And <i>the</i> second <i>commandment</i> is similar to it, You will love* your neighbor like yourself.</b> {Lev. 19:18} 
22:40 <b>In these two commandments hangs the whole law and the prophets.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 12:35-37 &amp; Mt 22:41-46 &amp; Lk 20:41-44.}</p>
<p>22:41 Now the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus asked them <i>a question</i>, 
22:42 saying, <b>What do you* think concerning the Christ? Whose son is he?</b></p>
<p>They say to him, David’s.</p>
<p>22:43 He says to them, <b>Then* how does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,</b> 
22:44 <b>The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right, until I should place your enemies <i>as the</i> footstool of your feet?</b> {Psa. 110:1} 
22:45  <b>Therefore, if David calls him Lord, how is he his son?</b>

23:5 <b>And they are doing all their works to be seen by men. And they widen their phylacteries and magnify the hems of their garments,</b>  
23:6 <b>and they love the foremost-place in the suppers and the foremost seats in the synagogues,</b>

<h3>Matthew 25</h3>
<p>25:1 <b>Then the kingdom of the heavens will be similar to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to <i>the</i> encounter of the bridegroom.</b> 
25:2 <b>Now five out of them were prudent and five were foolish.</b> 
25:3 <b>Those who <i>were</i> foolish, having taken their lamps, took no oil with them;</b> 
25:4 <b>but the prudent took oil in their containers with their lamps.</b> 
25:5 <b>Now the bridegroom <i>while he was</i> delaying, they all slumbered and were sleeping.</b> 
25:6 <b>But in <i>the</i> middle of <i>the</i> night, there has become an outcry, Behold, the bridegroom is coming! Go forth to <i>the</i> encounter of him.</b> 
25:7 <b>Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.</b> 
25:8 <b>Now the foolish said to the prudent, Give us <i>some oil</i> from your* oil, because our lamps are quenched.</b> 
25:9 <b>But the prudent answered, saying, <i>No</i>, lest it might not be enough for us and you* <i>too</i>, but rather, travel to those who sell and buy for yourselves.</b> 
25:10 <b>But when* they are going away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were prepared entered with him to the marriage feast, and the door was locked.</b> 
25:11 <b>Later the rest of the virgins also came, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</b> 
25:12 <b>But he answered and said, Assuredly I am saying to you*, I do not know you*.</b> 
25:13 <b>Therefore watch, because you* do not know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.</b></p>
<br>
<p>25:14 <b>For* <i>it is</i> just-like a man, going abroad, <i>who</i> called his own bondservants and gave to them his possessions.</b> 
25:15 <b>And to one he gave five <i>silver</i> talants</b>  {5 x $1 million}<b>, but to another two, and to another one; to each according to his own ability, and immediately went abroad.</b> 
25:16 <b>Now he who received the five talants traveled, and took <i>them and</i> worked with* them, and made* another five talants.</b> 
25:17 <b>Likewise*, he who also <i>received</i> the two also gained another two.</b> 
25:18 <b>But he who received the one, having gone away, shoveled in the soil and hid his lord’s silver.</b> 
25:19 <b>Now after a long time, the lord of those bondservants comes <i>back</i>, and settles <i>the</i> account with them.</b> 
25:20 <b>And he who received the five talants came and brought the other five talants, saying, Lord, You gave to me five talants. Behold, I have gained <i>in addition</i> to them, another five talants.</b></p>
<p>25:21 <b>But his lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful bondservant. You were over a few things, I will designate you over many things; enter into the joy of your lord.</b></p>
<p>25:22 <b>Now he who also received the two talants came and said, Lord, You gave to me two talants. Behold, I have gained <i>in addition</i> to them, another two talants.</b></p>
<p>25:23 <b>His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful bondservant. You were faithful over a few things, I will designate you over many things; enter into the joy of your lord.</b></p>
<p>25:24 <b>Now he who also had received the one talant came and said, Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering from where you did not scatter;</b> 
25:25 <b>and I was afraid and went away and hid your talant in the soil. Behold, you have your own.</b></p>
<br>
<p>25:26 <b>But his lord answered and said to him, You evil and lazy bondservant, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather from where I did not scatter?</b>  
25:27 <b>Therefore, you ought to have put my silver with the bankers, and <i>at my</i> coming, I might get back my own together with interest.</b> 
25:28 <b>Therefore, take away the talant from him and give it to him who has the ten talants.</b> 
25:29 <b>For* to everyone who has will be given <i>more</i>, and he will abound, but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</b> 
25:30 <b>And cast out the useless bondservant into the outer darkness– the weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be there.</b></p>
<p>25:31 <b>But whenever the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the holy messengers with him. Then he will sit upon <i>the</i> throne of his glory;</b> 
25:32 <b>and all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate* them one from another, like the shepherd separates* the sheep from the goats;</b> 
25:33 <b>and he will indeed stand the sheep at his right, but the goats at the left.</b> 
25:34 <b>Then the King will say to those at his right, Come-here, those who have been blessed from my Father, inherit the kingdom which has been prepared for you* from the conception of the world:</b> 
25:35 <b>for* I was hungry and you* gave me <i>food</i> to eat; I was thirsty and you* <i>gave</i> me a drink; I was a stranger and you* brought* me <i>in</i>;</b> 
25:36 <b><i>I was</i> naked and you* dressed me; I was sick and you* visited me; I was in prison and you* came to me.</b></p>
<p>25:37 <b>Then the righteous will answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry and nourish you? Or thirsty and gave you a drink?</b> 
25:38 <b>But when did we see you <i>as</i> a stranger and bring* you in? Or naked and dressed you?</b> 
25:39 <b>But when did we see you sick or in prison and came to you?</b></p>

25:41 <b>Then he will also say to them at the left, Go-onward away from me, you* those who have been cursed into the everlasting fire which has been prepared for the Devil and his messengers:</b> 
25:42 <b>for* I was hungry and you* did not give me <i>anything</i> to eat; I was thirsty and you* gave me nothing to drink;</b>

<p>{Mk 14:1-2 &amp; Mt 26:1-5 &amp; Lk 22:1-2 mountain Olives, Bethany, Jerusalem, Tues. Evening, Wed. for the Jews.}</p>
<p>26:1 And it happened, when Jesus <i>had</i> completed all these words, he said to his disciples, 
26:2 <b>You* know that after two days the Passover happens and the Son of Man is given up, *that* he might be crucified.</b></p>
<p>26:3 Then the high-priests and the scribes and the elders of the people were gathered together to the courtyard of the high-priest, who was called* Caiaphas; 
26:4 and they counseled together that* they might take-hold of Jesus with treachery, and might kill him. 
26:5 But they were saying, Not at the feast, in order that an uproar among the people might not happen.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 14:3-9 &amp; Mt 26:6-13.}</p>
<p>26:6 Now when* Jesus happened <i>to be</i> in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 
26:7 a woman came to him, having an alabaster flask of precious perfume, and she poured it upon his head <i>when he was</i> reclining <i>at the table</i>. 
26:8 But when* his disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, To what <i>purpose</i> is this waste? 
26:9 For* this perfume might have been sold* for much and given to the poor.</p>
<p>26:10 But Jesus knowing it, said to them, <b>Why are you* harassing the woman? For* she has worked a good work *for me.</b> 
26:11 <b>For* you* always have the poor with you*, but you* do not always have me.</b> 
26:12 <b>For* in that she put this perfume upon my body, she did <i>it</i> for my burial.</b> 
26:13 <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, Wherever this good-news is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of *for a memorial of her.</b></p>

<p>26:14 Then one of the twelve, who was called* Judas Iscariot, traveled to the high-priests 
26:15 and said, What are you* willing to give me and I will give him to you*? Now they weighed <i>out</i> thirty <i>pieces of</i> silver for him. 
26:16 And he was seeking an opportunity from then <i>onward</i> that* he might give him <i>to them</i>.</p>

<p>26:17 Now on the first <i>day</i> of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where do you wish that we prepare for you to eat the Passover?</p>
<p>26:18 Now he said, <b>Go into the city to a certain-person, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time <i>is</i> near. I will make* the Passover with you <i>at your house</i> with my disciples.</b> 
26:19 <b>And the disciples did like Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.</b></p>

<p>26:20 Now when* it became evening, he was reclining <i>at the table</i> with the twelve.</p>
<p>26:21 And while* they are eating, he said, <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, that one out of you will give me up.</b></p>
<p>26:22 And they were extremely sorrowful, and each of them began to say to him, It is not me Lord, is it?</p>
<p>26:23 But he answered and said, <b>He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, this one will give me up <i>to the Jews</i>.</b> 
26:24 <b>The Son of Man indeed is going, just-as it has been written concerning him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is given up! It was</b>  {i.e. would be} <b>good for him if that man had not been born.</b> {Ps 22:1-31?}</p>
<p>26:25 Now Judas, (who is giving him up <i>to the Jews</i>), answered and said, It is not me, is it Rabbi?</p>
<p>He says to him, <b>You have said <i>so</i>.</b></p>

26:27 And having taken the cup and given-thanks, he gave <i>it</i> to them, saying, <b>Drink from it, all <i>of you*</i>;</b> 
26:28 <b>for* this is my blood of the new covenant*, which is poured out on behalf of many to <i>obtain the</i> forgiveness of sins.</b>

<p>26:30 And having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mountain of Olives.</p>
<br>
<p>{See Mt 26:31-35 above.}</p>
<p>26:31 Then Jesus says to them, <b>All <i>of</i> you* will be offended at me this night; for* it has been written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</b> {Zech. 13:7} 
26:32 <b>But after I arise, I will precede you* into Galilee.</b></p>
<p>26:33 But Peter answered and said to him, If all will be offended at you, I will never* be offended.</p>
<p>26:34 Jesus said to him, <b>Assuredly I am saying to you that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three-times.</b></p>
<p>26:35 Peter says to him, Should it also be essential <i>for</i> me to die together with you, I may never* deny you. All the disciples also said likewise.</p>
<br>
<p>{See Mt 
26:30 above.}</p>
<p>26:36 Then Jesus comes to a parcel of ground with them, called* Gethsemane, and says to his disciples, <b>Sit <i>over</i> there, until I go <i>over</i> there* and might pray.</b> 
26:37 And he took with <i>him</i> Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and disheartened. 
26:38 Then he says to them, <b>My soul is very sorrowful, <i>even</i> to death. Remain here and watch with me.</b></p>
<p>26:39 And when* he went forward a little, he fell upon his face and prayed, saying, <b>My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; however, not as I will, but as you <i>will</i>.</b></p>
<p>26:40 And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping and says to Peter, <b>What, were you* not strong-enough to watch with me one hour?</b> 
26:41 <b>Watch and pray, that* you* may not enter into temptation. The spirit is indeed eager, but the flesh is weak.</b></p>
<p>26:42 Having gone away again a second-time, he prayed, saying, <b>My Father, if this cup is not able to pass from me, if I do not drink it– let your will happen.</b></p>
<p>26:43 And he came again and finds them sleeping, for* their eyes were heavy. 
26:44 And he left them again and went away and prayed a third-time, saying <i>again</i> the same words.</p>
<p>26:45 Then he comes to his disciples and says to them, <b>Furthermore, are you* sleeping and resting yourselves? Behold, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of Man is given up into the hands of sinners.</b> 
26:46  <b>Arise, we should be going. Behold, he who is giving me up <i>to the Jews</i> has drawn near.</b></p>

<p>26:47 And while* he is still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, from the high-priest and elders of the people. 
26:48 Now he who is giving him up, gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I kiss; that is him; take-hold of him. 
26:49 And immediately he came to Jesus and said, Hail, Rabbi. And he kissed him.</p>
<p>26:50 But Jesus said to him, <b>Comrade, *for what <i>purpose</i> are you here?</b> Then they came and put hands upon Jesus and took-hold of him. 
26:51 And behold, one of those who was with Jesus stretched out his hand and pulled his sword, and struck the bondservant of the high-priest, and took off his ear.</p>
<p>26:52 Then Jesus says to him, <b>Return your sword into its place; for* all those who take <i>up the</i> sword will perish with* the sword.</b> 
26:53 <b>Or do you think that I am not able now to plead with my Father and he will <i>not</i> stand beside me <i>with</i> more than twelve legions of messengers?</b> 
26:54 <b>Then* how might the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it is essential to happen <i>as</i> thus?</b></p>
<p>26:55 Jesus said to the crowds in that hour, <b><i>Why</i> have you* come out with swords and clubs, like against a robber, to take me? I was sitting daily with you* in the temple, teaching, and you* did not take-hold of me.</b> 
26:56  <b>But this whole thing has happened, in order that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.</b> Then all the disciples left him and fled.</p>

<br>
<p>{Mk 14:55-65 &amp; Mt 26:59-68 &amp; Lk 22:63-65.}</p>
<p>26:59 Now the high-priests and the elders and the whole council were seeking false testimony against Jesus, how they might slay him; 
26:60 and they did not find <i>any</i>, even <i>though</i> many false witnesses came. <i>Still</i>, they did not find <i>any</i>. 
26:61 But later, two false witnesses came and were saying, This one said, I am able to tear-down the temple of God and to build it <i>again</i> in three days.</p>
<p>26:62 And the high-priest, having stood up, said to him, Are you answering nothing? What are these <i>witnesses</i> testifying against you? 
26:63 But Jesus was silent. And the high-priest answered and said to him, I implore you <i>by oath</i> to the living God, that* you should tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God?</p>
<p>26:64 Jesus said to him, <b>You have said <i>so</i>, but I am saying to you*, From now on you* will see the Son of Man sitting at the right <i>hand</i> of power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven.</b></p>
<p>26:65 Then the high-priest ripped his garments, saying, He has blasphemed. Why do we still have need of witnesses? Behold, now you* have heard his blasphemy. 
26:66 What are you* thinking?</p>
<p>They answered and said, He is liable for death. 
26:67 Then they spat at his face and battered him, and some slapped him, 
26:68 saying, Prophesy to us, you Christ. Who is he who struck you?</p>

<p>26:69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a maidservant came to him, saying, You were also with Jesus the Galilean.</p>
<p>26:70 But he denied <i>it</i> before them all, saying, I do not know what you are saying.</p>
<p>26:71 Now having gone out into the gate <i>area</i>, another <i>one</i> saw him, and says to those who were there, This one was also with Jesus the Nazarene.</p>
<p>26:72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</p>
<p>26:73 Now after a little <i>while</i>, those who are standing <i>by</i>, came and said to Peter, You truly also are <i>one</i> out of them; for* even your speech makes* it evident.</p>
<p>26:74 Then he began to curse and to swear, I do not know the man. Now immediately, the rooster crowed. 
26:75 And Peter remembered the declaration which Jesus had said to him, <b>Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three-times.</b> And he went outside and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>{Mk 15:2-5 &amp; Mt 27:11-14 &amp; Lk 23:2-5 &amp; Jn 18:28b-38 Jerusalem early Friday morning.}</p>
<p>27:11 Now Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews?</p>
<p>Now Jesus said to him, <b>You speak <i>it correctly</i>.</b> 
27:12 And while* he was accused by the high-priests and the elders, he answered nothing.</p>
<p>27:13 Then Pilate says to him, Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you? 
27:14 And he did not answer him, not even one word; so-that the governor marveled exceedingly.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 15:6-19 &amp; Mt 27:15-30 &amp; Jn 18:39-
19:16 Friday, April 7, 30AD.}</p>
<p>27:15 Now the governor had been accustomed at <i>the</i> feast to release one prisoner to the crowd, whom they willed. 
27:16 Now then they were holding a notable prisoner called Barabbas. 
27:17 Therefore, having been gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you* wish that I may release to you*? Barabbas or Jesus who is called* Christ? 
27:18 For* he knew that they had given him up because of envy.</p>
<p>27:19 Now <i>while</i> sitting upon the judicial-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, <i>Have</i> nothing <i>between</i> you and that righteous <i>man</i>; for* I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.</p>
<p>27:20 Now the high-priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that* they should ask for Barabbas and might destroy Jesus. 
27:21 But the governor answered and said to them, Whom from the two do you* will that I may release to you*?</p>
<p>But they said, Barabbas!</p>
<p>27:22 Pilate says to them, Then* what should I do <i>to</i> Jesus who is called* Christ?</p>
<p>They all say to him, Let him be crucified!</p>
<p>27:23 But the governor said, For* what evil has he done?</p>
<p>But they were crying out even-more, saying, Let him be crucified!</p>
<p>27:24 Pilate seeing he profited nothing, but rather that an uproar is happening, took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; you* see <i>to it</i>.</p>
<p>27:25 And all the people answered and said, His blood <i>be</i> upon us and upon our children.</p>
<p>27:26 Then he released to them Barabbas, but he scourged Jesus and gave <i>him</i> up in order that he should be crucified.</p>
<br>
<p>27:27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the palace and gathered together the whole cohort {600 soldiers} to him. 
27:28 And they stripped him and placed a scarlet cloak around him. 
27:29 And they braided a crown from thorns and placed it upon his head and a reed upon his right <i>hand</i>, and they knelt down before him and were mocking him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! 
27:30 And having spit at him, they took the reed and were beating him in the head.</p>
<p>{Mk 15:20-23 &amp; Mt 27:31-34 &amp; Lk 23:26-33 &amp; Jn 
19:17 Road to the Cross, Friday morning.}</p>
<p>27:31 And when they had mocked him, they stripped the cloak <i>off</i> him and clothed <i>him</i> with his own garments and led him away, *that* they may crucify him.</p>
<br>
<p>27:32 Now <i>while</i> going out, they found a man from Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled him to go <i>with them</i>, that* he might lift up his cross.</p>
<br>
<p>27:33 And they came to a place called* Golgotha, which is to say, the place of a skull, 
27:34 they gave him vinegar to drink, having been mixed with gall and having tasted <i>it</i>, he was not willing to drink <i>it</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 15:24-32 &amp; Mt 27:35-44 &amp; Lk 23:33-43 &amp; Jn 19:18-27 
9:00 until Noon, Friday.}</p>
<p>27:35 Now having crucified him, ‘they divided his garments among them, casting a lot'; {T} <i>in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, ‘They divided my garments among them and they cast a lot for my garment.’</i> {Psa 22. 18} 
27:36 And sitting down, they were guarding him there. 
27:37 And they placed above his head an accusation that had been written, This Is Jesus the King of the Jews. 
27:38 Then two robbers are crucified together with him, one at the right and one at the left. 
27:39 Now those who traveled by were blaspheming him, wagging their heads, 
27:40 and saying, You who <i>said he will</i> tear-down the temple and build it in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.</p>
<p>27:41 Now likewise, also the high-priests with the scribes and elders, mocking <i>him, and</i> were saying, 
27:42 He saved others<i>, but yet</i> he is not able to save himself. If he is <i>the</i> King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross and we will believe in him. 
27:43 He has confidence in God. Let him rescue him now, if he is willing <i>to save</i> him; for* he said, I am the Son of God. 
27:44 Now the robbers who were also crucified together with him were reproaching him <i>with</i> the same thing.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 
15:34 &amp; Mt 
27:45 &amp; Lk 
23:44 around Noon.}</p>
<p>27:45 Now there became darkness upon all the earth from the sixth hour until the ninth hour {i.e. Noon until 
3:00 PM}.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 15:34-41 &amp; Mt 27:46-56 &amp; Lk 23:45-49 &amp; Jn 19:28-30 around 
5:00 PM.}</p>
<p>27:46 Now around the ninth hour {i.e. 
3:00 PM} Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <b>Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?</b> That is, ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ {Psa 22:1}</p>
<p>27:47 But some of them standing there, when* they heard it, were saying, This one is summoning Elijah. 
27:48 And immediately one out of them ran, taking a sponge and filled it with vinegar and placed it around a reed and were giving <i>it to</i> him to drink.</p>
<p>27:49 But the rest were saying, Allow <i>it, that</i> we may see if Elijah comes; he will save him.</p>
<p>27:50 Now Jesus, having cried again with a loud voice, his spirit leaves. 
27:51 And behold, the curtain of the temple was split-apart into two <i>pieces,</i> from the top to the bottom, and the earth shook, and the rocks were split-apart; 
27:52 and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the holy-ones who had fallen-asleep were raised. 
27:53 And coming forth out of the tombs after his awakening they entered into the holy city and appeared to many. 
27:54 Now the centurion and those guarding Jesus with him, having seen the earthquake and the things that happened, were extremely afraid, saying, This truly was the Son of God. 
27:55 Now many women were there viewing from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him: 
27:56 among whom was Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joses and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 15:42-47 &amp; Mt 27:57-66 &amp; Lk 23:50-56 &amp; Jn 19:31-42 Before The Sabbath.}</p>
<p>27:57 Now when* it became evening, a rich man came from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also made himself a disciple to Jesus. 
27:58 This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up. 
27:59 And Joseph took the body and entwined it in a clean linen cloth, 
27:60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewed out in the rock and he rolled a great stone against the door of the tomb and went away. 
27:61 Now Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting in front of the burial chamber.</p>
<br>
<p>27:62 Now on the next-day, which is <i>the day</i> after the Preparation, the high-priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate, 
27:63 saying, Lord, we remember <i>what</i> that misleader said, <i>while</i> still living, I <i>will</i> arise after three days. 
27:64 Therefore, command that the burial chamber be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples coming by night, might steal him away and might say to the people, He was raised from the dead and the last deceit will be worse <i>than</i> the first.</p>
<p>27:65 Pilate said to them, You* have a sentry. Go, make <i>it as</i> secure as you* know <i>how</i>. 
27:66 So they traveled and secured the burial chamber, sealing the stone, with the sentry.</p>
<h3>Matthew 28</h3>
<p>{Mk 16:1-8 &amp; Mt 28:1-8 &amp; Lk 24:1-8, 12 &amp; Jn 20:1-10 Dawn and very early Sunday.}</p>
<p>28:1 Now after the Sabbath day, <i>as it was</i> dawning toward the first <i>daylight</i> of the week, Mary the Magdalene came and the other Mary to view the burial chamber. 
28:2 And behold, there became a great earthquake; for* a messenger of the Lord, having come down from heaven, came and rolled away the stone from the door and was sitting upon it. 
28:3 His form was like lightning and his clothing <i>was</i> white like snow; 
28:4 and those who are guarding <i>the door</i>, shook out of fear of him and became like dead men.</p>
<p>28:5 Now the messenger answered and said to the women, Do not be afraid; for* I know that you* are seeking Jesus, who has been crucified. 
28:6 He is not here; for* he was raised, just-as he said. Come-here, behold the place where the Lord was laying. 
28:7 And travel quickly and tell his disciples, He was raised from the dead, and behold, he precedes you* into Galilee; you* will see him there. Behold, I have said <i>this</i> to you*.</p>
<p>28:8 And having gone out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to report to his disciples.</p>
<p>{Mk 16:9-11 &amp; Mt 28:9-10 &amp; Lk 24:9-11 &amp; Jn 20:11-18.}</p>
<p>28:9 Now as they were traveling to also report <i>it</i> to his disciples, behold, Jesus encountered them, saying, <b>Hail!</b> But they came and took-hold of his feet and worshiped him. 
28:10 Then Jesus says to them, <b>Do not be afraid. Go; report to my brethren in order that they might go into Galilee and they will see me there.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 28:11-15 Sunday Morning; no parallel.}</p>
<p>28:11 Now <i>while</i> traveling, behold, some of the sentries came into the city and reported to the high-priests all the things that <i>had</i> happened. 
28:12 And having been gathered together with the elders and having taken counsel, they gave a considerable <i>amount of</i> silver to the soldiers, 
28:13 saying, Say: when* we fell-asleep, his disciples came by night and stole him away. 
28:14 And if this is heard by the governor, we will persuade him and will make* you* carefree. 
28:15 So they took the silver and did like they were taught and this speech was broadcasted among the Jews <i>and is continuing</i> till this day.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 28:16-17 &amp; 1Cor: 
15:6 Mountain in Galilee.}</p>
<p>28:16 But the eleven disciples traveled into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had commanded them. 
28:17 And seeing him, they worshiped him, but some were skeptical.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 16:15-18 &amp; Mt 28:18-20 &amp; Lk 24:46-47 Mountain in Galilee; The Great Commission.}</p>
<p>28:18 And Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, <b>All authority has been given to me in heaven and upon earth.</b></p>
<p>28:19 <b>When you* travel, make disciples of all the nations, immersing* them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</b> 
28:20 <b>teaching them to observe all things, as many things as I have commanded you*, and behold, I am with you* all the days until the end of the world.</b></p>
<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the good-news of the kingdom of God,

<p>1:16 Now walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, <i>who are</i> Simon’s <i>sons</i>, casting a net in the sea; for* they were fishermen. 
1:17 And Jesus said to them, <b>Come-here after me and I will make* you* to become fishermen of men.</b> 
1:18 And immediately they left their nets and followed him. 
1:19 And having advanced a few <i>feet</i> from there, he saw James and John his brother, the <i>son</i>s of Zebedee, and they <i>were</i> in the ship mending the nets. 
1:20 And immediately he called them. And they left their father Zebedee with the hired <i>servants</i> in the ship and went after him.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:21-28 &amp; Lk 4:31-37 Capernaum.}</p>
<p>1:21 And they travel into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and was teaching. 
1:22 And they were being astounded at his teaching; for* he was teaching them like <i>one</i> having authority and not like the scribes.</p>
<p>1:23 And a man was in their synagogue in <i>him was</i> an unclean spirit, and he cried out, 
1:24 saying, Ah! What <i>is it</i> to us and to you, Jesus <i>the</i> Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you, <i>I know</i> who you are, the Holy One of God.</p>
<p>1:25 And Jesus rebuked it, saying, <b>Hush and come out of him.</b></p>
<p>1:26 And the unclean spirit came out of him, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice. 
1:27 And they were all amazed, so-that <i>they began</i> to debate together with themselves, saying, What is this? What new teaching <i>is</i> this that he commands even the unclean spirits with authority, and they are obeying* him.</p>
<p>1:28 Now the report of him went out immediately, into the whole region around Galilee.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:29-34 &amp; Mt 8:14-17 &amp; Lk 4:38-41 Capernaum.}</p>
<p>1:29 And immediately, having come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
1:30 Now Simon’s mother-in-law was laying, fevered, and immediately they speak to him concerning her. 
1:31 And having come near, he took-hold of her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her and she was serving them.</p>
<br>
<p>1:32 Now when* it became evening, when the sun set, they were bringing to him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed. 
1:33 And the whole city was gathered together <i>next</i> to the door. 
1:34 And he healed many who were ill with various diseases, and cast out many demons, and he was not allowing the demons to speak, because they knew him.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:35-39 &amp; Mt 4:23-25 &amp; Lk 4:42-44 Preaching through Galilee.}</p>
<p>1:35 And exceedingly <i>early,</i> having risen* up in the morning, <i>while yet</i> at night, he came out and went away into a desolate place, and he was praying there. 
1:36 And Simon, and those who were with him, pursued him; 
1:37 and having found him, they say to him, All are seeking you.</p>
<br>
<p>1:38 And he says to them, <b>We should be going into the next towns, that* I might also preach there; for* I have come *for this <i>purpose</i>.</b>

<p>1:40 And a leper comes to him, pleading to him, and kneeling <i>down</i> to him and saying to him, If you are willing, you are able to cleanse me.</p>
<p>1:41 Now Jesus, having compassion on <i>him</i>, stretched out his hand, touched him and says to him, <b>I am willing. Be cleansed.</b> 
1:42 And having spoken, the leprosy immediately went away from him and he was cleansed. 
1:43 And he scolded him and immediately sent him out, 
1:44 and says to him, <b>See <i>that</i> you say nothing to anyone, but go; show yourself to the priest, and offer the things which Moses commanded concerning your cleansing *for a testimony to them.</b> {Lev. 13:49, 14:2-4} 
1:45 But he went out and began to preach <i>it</i> much, and to broadcast the word, so-that he {i.e. Jesus} was no longer able to openly enter into <i>the</i> city, but was outside in desolate places, and they were coming to him from everywhere.</p>

2:2 And immediately many were gathered together, so-that <i>it was</i> no longer <i>possible</i> to make room, not even <i>next</i> to the door, and he was speaking the word to them.</p>
<p>2:3 And they come, carrying to him a paralytic, lifted up by four <i>men.</i> 
2:4 And when* they were not able to draw near to him because of the crowd, they unroofed the roof where he was. And having dug out <i>a hole in it</i>, they lowered the pallet upon which the paralytic was laying. 
2:5 Now Jesus saw their faith and says to the paralytic, <b>Son, your sins have been forgiven you.</b></p>
<p>2:6 But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 
2:7 Why is this man speaking blasphemies so? Who is able to forgive sins except one, <i>our</i> God?</p>
<p>2:8 And immediately Jesus, having fully known in his spirit that they reason so in themselves, said to them, <b>Why are you* reasoning these things in your* hearts?</b>  
2:9 <b>Which is easier to say to the paralytic, Your sins have been forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and lift up your pallet and walk?</b> 
2:10 <b>But that* you* may know that the Son of Man has authority upon the earth to forgive sins</b> (he says to the paralytic), 
2:11 <b>I say to you, Arise and lift up your pallet and go to your house.</b></p>

2:16 And the scribes and the Pharisees, having seen him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, were saying to his disciples, <i>Why is it</i> that he is eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners?</p>
<p>2:17 And when* Jesus heard it, he says to them, <b>Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</b></p>
<br>
<p>2:18 And the disciples of John, and those of the Pharisees, were fasting, and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?</p>
<p>2:19 And Jesus said to them, <b>The sons of the bridal-party</b> {companions or guests} <b>are not able to fast at which <i>time</i> the bridegroom is with them, are they? Inasmuch time as they have the bridegroom with them, they are not able to fast.</b> 
2:20 <b>But the days will come, whenever the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast in those days.</b>

3:4 Now he says to them, <b>Is it legal on the Sabbath day to do good or to do evil? To save a life or to kill?</b> But they were silent. 
3:5 And having looked around at them with anger, being sorrowful at the hardening of their heart, he says to the man, <b>Stretch out your hand.</b> And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored <i>as</i> healthy as the other. 
3:6 And the Pharisees went out and immediately were making* a counsel against him with the Herodians, how they might destroy him.</p>

<p>3:7 And Jesus departed to the sea with his disciples, and a large multitude followed him from Galilee and from Judea, 
3:8 and from Jerusalem and from Idumaea, and beyond-that of the Jordan, and those around Tyre and Sidon. <i>This</i> large multitude, having heard how-much he was doing, came to him. 
3:9 And he spoke to his disciples, that* a small-boat should wait-on him because of the crowd, that* they might not press against him;

<p>3:22 And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem were saying, He has Beelzebub, and, He is casting out the demons by the ruler of the demons.</p>
<p>3:23 And having called them, he was speaking to them in parables: <b>How is the Adversary able to cast out the Adversary?</b> 
3:24 <b>And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand.</b> 
3:25 <b>And if a house is divided against itself, that house is not able to stand.</b>

<p>{Mk 4:1-25 &amp; Mt 13:1-23 &amp; Lk 8:4-18 Sea of Galilee.}</p>
<p>4:1 And again he began to teach by the sea. And a large crowd was gathered together to him, so-that having stepped onto the ship, he sat in the sea, and all the crowd were <i>next</i> to the sea upon the land.</p>
<p>4:2 And he was teaching them many things in parables and said to them in his teaching, 
4:3 <b>Listen: behold, the sower went forth to sow,</b> 
4:4 <b>and it happened, while* he was sowing, some <i>seed</i> fell by the road and the birds came and devoured it.</b> 
4:5 <b>But other <i>seed</i> fell upon the rocky-area, where it did not have much earth, and immediately it rose up, because it had no depth of earth;</b> 
4:6 <b>now when* the sun rose, it was burnt, and it dried up because it had no root.</b> 
4:7 <b>And other <i>seed</i> fell among the thorns, and the thorns shot up and choked it, and it gave no fruit.</b> 
4:8 <b>And other <i>seed</i> fell into the good soil and it was giving fruit, shooting up and growing, and it was bringing <i>forth</i> by thirty <i>times</i>, and by sixty <i>times</i>, and by a hundred <i>times as much.</i></b> 
4:9  <b>And he said, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</b></p>
<br>
<p>4:10 And when he happened <i>to be</i> alone, those who were around him together with the twelve, asked <i>about</i>  the parable. 
4:11 And he said to them, <b>You* have been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things happen in parables;</b> 
4:12 <b>that* seeing, they may see and <i>yet</i> may not know, and hearing, they may hear and <i>yet</i> may not understand; lest they should turn again and <i>their</i> sins might be forgiven them.</b></p>
<p>4:13 And he says to them, <b>Do you* not know this parable? And how will you* know all the parables?</b> 
4:14  <b>The sower is sowing the word.</b> 
4:15 <b>Now these are those by the road, where the word is sown, and whenever they hear, immediately the Adversary comes and takes away the word which has been sown in their hearts.</b></p>
<p>4:16 <b>And likewise, these are those who are sown upon the rocky-areas, who, whenever they hear the word, they immediately receive it with joy;</b> 
4:17 <b>and they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Thereafter, when* affliction or persecution has happened <i>to them</i> because of the word, immediately they stumble.</b></p>
<br>
<p>4:18 <b>And these are those who are sown among the thorns; these are those who hear the word,</b> 
4:19 <b>and the anxieties of this world, and the deception of riches, and the lusts concerning <i>all</i> the rest <i>of the worldly things</i> travel into <i>their hearts</i>, are choking the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</b></p>
<p>4:20 <b>And these are those who were sown upon the good soil; who hear the word and accept it, and bear-fruit, by thirty <i>times</i> and by sixty <i>times</i> and by a hundred <i>times</i>.</b></p>
<br>
<p>4:21 And he said to them, <b>Do <i>you</i> come <i>with</i> a lamp that* it might be placed under a peck container or under the bed? No, <i>you bring it</i> that* it might be placed upon the lamp-stand.</b> 
4:22 <b>For* there is not anything hidden, <i>that</i> it should not be made manifest, nor has <i>anything</i> secret happened, but that* it should come into apparent <i>view</i>.</b> 
4:23 <b>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.</b></p>
<p>4:24 And he said to them, <b>Beware what you* are hearing; in what measure you* measure, it will be measured to you*, and to you* who hear, <i>more</i> will be added.</b> 
4:25 <b>For* whoever has, to him will be given, and he who does not have, then what he has will be taken from him.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 4:26-29; no parallel.}</p>
<p>4:26 And he said, <b>So is the kingdom of God, as if a man cast seed upon the earth;</b> 
4:27 <b>and he should sleep and should arise night and day, and the seed may sprout and should lengthen, he does not know how.</b> 
4:28  <b>For* the earth is bearing-fruit by herself; first the blade, thereafter the top, then the full grain in the top.</b>  
4:29 <b>But whenever the fruit is giving <i>way</i>, immediately he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest is standing <i>ready</i>.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 13:24-30.}</p>
<p>{Mk 4:30-34 &amp; Mt 13:31-35.}</p>
<p>4:30 And he said, <b>To what may be similar to the kingdom of God? Or in what parable may we put it <i>in comparison</i>?</b> 
4:31 <b><i>It is</i> like a kernel of a mustard-seed, which, whenever it is sown upon the earth, <i>though</i> it is least <i>compared to</i> all the seeds that are upon the earth,</b> 
4:32 <b>yet whenever it has been sown, it shoots up and becomes greater <i>than</i> all the herbs and produces great branches; so-that the birds of the heaven are able to nest under its shadow.</b></p>
<br>
<p>4:33 And he was speaking the word to them with many such parables, as they were able to hear it. 
4:34 But he was not speaking to them without a parable, but privately he was interpreting all things for his disciples.</p>

4:36 And having left the crowd, they take him with <i>them</i>, as he was in the ship. But also other small-boats were with him. 
4:37 And there becomes a great gale of wind, and the waves were putting <i>water</i> into the ship, so-that the ship now was being filled <i>with water</i>. 
4:38 And he himself was upon the stern, sleeping upon the cushion, and they arouse him <i>from his sleep</i> and say to him, Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?</p>
<p>4:39 And he was aroused and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, <b>Be silent. Hush.</b> And the wind paused and there became a great calm. 
4:40 And he said to them, <b>Why are you* so cowardly? How do you* not have faith?</b></p>
<p>4:41 And they feared <i>with</i> a great fear, and were saying to one another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea are obeying* him?</p>
<h3>Mark 5</h3>
<p>{Mk 5:1-21 &amp; Mt 8:28-34 &amp; Lk 8:26-40 Gergesa.}</p>
<p>5:1 And they came to the <i>area</i> of the sea beyond-that, into the region of the Gadarenes. 
5:2 And having come out of the ship, immediately a man encountered him out of the tombs in <i>him was</i> an unclean spirit, 
5:3 who had his dwelling in the tombs, and no one was able to bind him, not even with chains. 
5:4 Because <i>of</i> that, he had been bound often with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn to shreds by him and the shackles had been crushed, and no one was strong-enough to tame him. 
5:5 And he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones, night and day, in the mountains and in the tombs.</p>
<br>
<p>5:6 Now when* he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped him; 
5:7 and crying out with a loud voice, he said, What <i>is this thing</i> with me and with you, Jesus, Son of the Highest God? I am imploring you by God, do not torment me.</p>
<p>5:8 For* he said to him, <b>Come out of the man, <i>you</i> unclean spirit.</b> 
5:9 And he asked him, <b>What is your name?</b></p>
<p>And he answered, saying, My name is Legion, because we are many. 
5:10 And he was pleading with him much that* he might not send them away outside the region. 
5:11 Now a great herd of swine was feeding there before the mountain. 
5:12 And all the demons pleaded with him, saying, Send us into the swine, that* we may enter into them. 
5:13 And Jesus immediately permitted them. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine and the herd rushed down the cliff into the sea. Now they were approximately two thousand, and they were choking in the sea.</p>
<p>5:14 Now those feeding the swine fled and reported it to the city and to the rural-area. And they came out to see what it was that has happened. 
5:15 And they come to Jesus and were viewing he who was demon-possessed and had the legion, sitting and he had <i>his</i> garments on and <i>was</i> sensible, and they were afraid. 
5:16 But those who saw it described to them how it happened to he who was demon-possessed and concerning the swine. 
5:17 And they began to plead with him to go away from their borders.</p>
<br>
<p>5:18 And when* he stepped into the ship, he who had been demon-possessed was pleading with him that* he might be with him. 
5:19 But Jesus did not allow him, but says to him, <b>Go to your house, to your own and report to them how-much the Lord has done for you and <i>how</i> he showed-mercy on you.</b> 
5:20 And he traveled and began to preach in Decapolis how-much Jesus had done for him and all were marveling.</p>
<br>
<p>5:21 And when* Jesus had ferried over again in the ship to the <i>area</i> beyond-that, a large crowd was gathered to him, and he was by the sea.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 5:22-43 &amp; Mt 9:18-26 &amp; Lk 8:41-56 Capernaum.}</p>
<p>5:22 And behold one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, comes and seeing him, he falls at his feet; 
5:23 and was pleading with him much, saying, My young-daughter is holding on her last moments. <i>I pray</i> that* you come and might lay <i>your</i> hands on her, *that she may be cured and will live. 
5:24 And he went with him.</p>
<br>
<p>And a large crowd was following him and they were pressing against him. 
5:25 And a certain woman, being in <i>her</i> a flowing of blood <i>for</i> twelve years, 
5:26 and had suffered many things under many physicians and had spent all that she had and was profited nothing, but rather having come to <i>be</i> worse. 
5:27 Having heard concerning Jesus, she came in the crowd behind and touched his garment. 
5:28 For* she was saying, Even if I touch but his garments, I will be cured. 
5:29 And immediately the spring of her blood was dried up, and she knew that she had been healed from the disorder in <i>her</i> body. 
5:30 And immediately Jesus, fully knowing in himself that the power had gone forth from him and having turned <i>around</i> in the crowd, said, <b>Who touched my garments?</b></p>
<p>5:31 And his disciples were saying to him, You see the crowd pressing against you and you say, Who touched me? 
5:32 And he was looking around to see her who had done this thing. 
5:33 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what has happened upon her, came and fell down before him and spoke all the truth to him.</p>
<p>5:34 And he said to her, <b>Daughter, your faith has cured you; go in peace and be healthy from your disorder.</b></p>
<br>
<p>5:35 While* he is still speaking, they come from the ruler of the synagogue’s <i>house,</i> saying, Your daughter is dead. Why are you still bothering the Teacher?</p>
<p>5:36 But Jesus immediately having heard the word being spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, <b>Do not fear, only believe.</b> 
5:37 And he allowed no one to follow him, except Peter and James and John the brother of James. 
5:38 And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and he views an uproar, many weeping and wailing. 
5:39 And having entered in, he says to them, <b>Why are you* in an uproar and weeping? The child is not dead, but is sleeping.</b> 
5:40 And they were laughing at him. But having cast them all out, he takes the father of the child and her mother and those with him and he went-onward into where the child was reclining. 
5:41 And taking-hold of the child by the hand, he says to her, <b>Talitha kumi;</b> which is, <i>after</i> being translated, Girl, I say to you, Arise. 
5:42 And immediately the girl rose* up and was walking; for* she was twelve years old. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. 
5:43 And he ordered them much that* no one should know this and he said that <i>something</i> should be given to her to eat.</p>

<p>6:1 And he went out from there, and he came into his fatherland, and his disciples follow him. 
6:2 And when* it became the Sabbath, he began to teach in the synagogue. And many hearing him were being astounded, saying, From where did this one <i>receive</i> these things? And what is the wisdom which has been given to this man? And <i>how</i> are such miracles happening through his hands? 
6:3 Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Jude and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they were being offended at him.</p>
<p>6:4 But Jesus said to them, <b>A prophet is not without honor, except in his fatherland and among <i>his own</i> relatives and in his own house.</b> 
6:5 And he was not able to do any miracle there, except that he laid his hands upon a few who were sick and healed them.

<br>
<p>{Mk 6:6b-13 &amp; Mt 9:35-

<p>And he was going around the villages in a circle, teaching.</p>
<p>6:7 And he calls to him the twelve and began to send them out two <i>by</i> two, and he was giving them authority over the unclean spirits; 
6:8 and he commanded them that* they should take nothing *for the journey, except only a staff; no knapsack, no bread, no brass <i>coins</i> in the belt; 
6:9 but <i>only</i> tied on sandals, also do not clothe yourselves with two tunics. 
6:10 And he said to them, <b>Wherever you* enter into a house, abide there until you* should go from there.</b> 
6:11 <b>And as many as may not accept you*, nor may not hear you*, <i>while</i> traveling out from there, shake-off the dust which is underneath your* feet *for a testimony to them.

<p>{Mk 6:14-29 &amp; Mt 14:1-12 &amp; Lk 9:7-9.}</p>
<p>6:14 And King Herod heard <i>of this</i>; for* his name had become apparent and he said, John the Immerser* was raised from the dead and because of this, these powers are working in him.</p>
<p>6:15 Others were saying, It is Elijah.</p>
<p>But others were saying, It is a prophet, like one of the prophets <i>of old.</i></p>
<p>6:16 But when* he heard <i>of it</i>, Herod said, John, whom I beheaded, it is he, he was raised from the dead.</p>
<br>
<p>6:17 For* Herod himself <i>had</i> sent forth and took-hold of John and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because he had married her. 
6:18 For* John said to Herod, ‘It is not legal for you to have your brother’s wife.’ 
6:19 But Herodias was holding it against him. And she was willing to kill him and was not able; 
6:20 for* Herod feared John, knowing him <i>to be</i> a righteous and holy man, and was protecting him. And having heard him, he was doing many things, and was gladly hearing him, <i>often</i>.</p>
<p>6:21 And when* it happened <i>to be</i> an opportune day, <i>along</i> with his birthday, when Herod made* a supper to his great-men and the commanders, and the foremost <i>men</i> of Galilee; 
6:22 and the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, and she pleased Herod and those who reclined <i>at the meal</i> together with him. And the king said to the girl, Ask me whatever you wish and I will give it to you. 
6:23 And he swore to her, Whatever you might ask me, I will give it to you, <i>up</i> to half of my kingdom.</p>
<p>6:24 Now she went out and said to her mother, What shall I ask <i>for</i>?</p>
<p>Now she said, The head of John the Immerser*.</p>
<p>6:25 And she came in promptly to the king and diligently asked, saying, I wish that* you might give me immediately the head of John the Immerser* upon a platter.</p>
<p>6:26 And the king became very sorrowful, but because of his oaths and those who reclined <i>at the meal</i> together with him, he did not wish to reject her. 
6:27 And immediately, the king sent forth an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. 
6:28 Now he went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head upon a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. 
6:29 And when* his disciples heard <i>of it</i>, they came and lifted up his corpse and laid it in a tomb.</p>

6:31 And he said to them, <b>You* yourselves come-here privately into a desolate place and rest yourselves a few.</b> For* there were many coming and going and they had not even <i>had</i>  an opportunity to eat. 
6:32 And they went away into a desolate place by ship privately.</p>

<p>{Mk 6:33-44 &amp; Mt 14:13-21 &amp; Lk 9:11-17 &amp; Jn 6:2-14.}</p>
<p>6:33 And the crowds saw them going and many recognized him and they ran together there on foot from all the cities and went before them, and came together to him. 
6:34 And Jesus came forth, and saw a large crowd and he had compassion upon them, because they were like sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things.</p>
<p>6:35 And <i>since it was</i> already becoming a late hour, his disciples came to him and say, The place is desolate and already <i>it is</i> a late hour; 
6:36 dismiss them, that* they <i>may</i> go into the rural-area and surrounding villages, and may buy bread for themselves, for* they might not have anything to eat.</p>
<p>6:37 But he answered and said to them, <b>Give them <i>something</i> to eat.</b></p>
<p>And they say to him, Should we go away and buy two hundred denarii <i>worth</i> of loaves, and might give them <i>that</i> to eat?</p>
<p>6:38 Now he says to them, <b>How many loaves do you* have? Go and see.</b></p>
<p>And when* they knew, they said, Five and two fish. 
6:39 And he commanded them all to recline by groups; <i>all the</i>  groups upon the pale-green grass. 
6:40 And they leaned-back <i>in</i> rows <i>of</i> a hundred apiece and rows <i>of</i> fifty apiece. 
6:41 And he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave-thanks and broke the loaves, and he was giving <i>them</i> to his disciples that* they might place <i>the bread</i> beside them, and he divided the two fish among them all. 
6:42 And they all ate and were fed. 
6:43 And they took up twelve baskets <i>of</i> broken pieces, and also <i>pieces</i> of the fish. 
6:44 And those who were eating the loaves <i>were</i> approximately five thousand men.</p>

<p>6:45 And immediately he urged his disciples to step onto the ship, and to precede <i>him</i> to the <i>area</i> beyond-that into Bethsaida, until he should dismiss the crowd. 
6:46 And after he had bid farewell to them, he went away into the mountain to pray.</p>
<p>6:47 And having become evening, the ship was in the middle of the sea and he <i>was</i> alone upon the land. 
6:48 And he saw them tormented by the rowing, for* the wind was adverse to them, and he comes to them around the fourth watch of the night, walking upon the sea, and he was willing to have passed by them. 
6:49 But when* they saw him walking upon the sea, they thought <i>it</i> to be an apparition and cried out; 
6:50 for* they all saw him and were disturbed. But immediately, he spoke with them, and says to them, <b>Have courage. I am <i>here</i>. Do not be afraid.</b> 
6:51 And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind paused, and they were exceedingly, exceptionally, astonished in themselves and marveled! 
6:52 For* they did not understand <i>what happened</i> on the loaves, for* their heart was hardening. 
6:53 And having ferried over, they came upon the land of Gennesaret and they were anchored <i>there</i>, 
6:54 and coming out of the ship, immediately <i>the people</i> recognized him.</p>
<br>
<p>6:55 Having ran around that whole region around <i>there</i>, they began to carry around those who were ill upon their pallets, where they were hearing: he is <i>over</i> there. 
6:56 And wherever he was traveling, <i>if</i> into villages or cities or the rural-area, they were laying the sick in the marketplaces and was pleading with him, that* if-only they might touch the hem of his garment, and as many as would touch him were being cured.</p>

<h3>Mark 7</h3>
<p>{Mk 7:1-23 &amp; Mt 15:1-20 &amp; Jn 
7:1 Galilee, probably Capernaum Spring 29 AD.}</p>
<p>7:1 And the Pharisees and some of the scribes are gathered together to <i>see</i> him, having come from Jerusalem, 
7:2 and having seen some of his disciples eating their bread with common, that is, unwashed hands, they found-fault. 
7:3 For* the Pharisees and all the Jews, if they do not wash their hands <i>scrubbing</i> with <i>the</i> fist, do not eat, holding-fast the tradition of the elders; 
7:4 and <i>when coming</i> from the marketplace, they do not eat if they do not immerse* {bathe} themselves <i>first</i>, and there are many other things which they took to holding-fast, <i>like</i> immersions* {Or, <i>O.T.</i> ceremonial washings} of cups and pint pitchers and brass kettles and cots. 
7:5 Thereafter, the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why are your disciples not walking according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?</p>
<p>7:6 But he answered and said to them, <b>Isaiah did prophesy well concerning you* hypocrites, as it has been written, ‘This people are honoring me with their lips, but their heart is faraway from me.</b> 
7:7 <b>But they are worshiping me in futility, teaching <i>as their</i> teachings– the commandments of men.’</b> {Isa 29:13} 
7:8 <b>For* <i>while</i> leaving the commandment of God, you* are holding-fast the tradition of men, <i>like</i> immersions* of pint pitchers and cups, and you* practice many other such similar things.</b></p>
<p>7:9 And he said to them, <b>You* reject well the commandment of God, that* you* may keep your* tradition.</b> 
7:10 <b>For* Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother.’</b> {Ex. 
20:12 &amp; Deu. 5:16} <b>And, ‘He who is speaking evil of father or mother, let him be ended <i>by the sentence of</i> death.’</b> {Ex. 
21:17 &amp; Lev. 20:9} 
7:11 <b>But you* say, If a man says to <i>his</i> father or <i>his</i> mother, Whatever you might have been profited from me is Corban.</b> (That is, a gift). 
7:12 <b>And <i>so</i> you* no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,</b>  
7:13 <b>invalidating the word of God by your* tradition, which you* have been given, and you* practice many such similar things.</b></p>
<p>7:14 And having called to him all the crowd again, he said to them, <b>All <i>of you*</i> hear me and understand.</b> 
7:15  <b>There is nothing outside the man, that traveling into him is able to desecrate him, but the things which travel out from him, those are the things which defile the man.</b> 
7:16 <b>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.</b></p>
<br>
<p>7:17 And when he entered into the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. 
7:18 And he says to them, <b>So are you* also without understanding? Are you* not perceiving, that whatever <i>is</i> outside, travels into the man, is not able to desecrate him;</b> 
7:19 <b>because it does not travel into his heart, but into his belly and travels into the sewer?</b> (<i>He said thus,</i> cleansing all foods.) 
7:20 Now he said, <b>What travels out from the man, this desecrates the man.</b> 
7:21 <b>For* evil reasonings travel from inside, out of the heart of men, <i>such as</i>: adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts,</b> 
7:22 <b>greedy-acts, wickednesses, treachery, unbridled-lusts, an evil eye, blasphemy, haughtiness, foolishness.</b> 
7:23 <b>All these evil things travel from inside, and desecrate the man.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 
7:24 &amp; Mt 15:21.}</p>
<p>7:24 And he stood up and went away from there, into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house and wished no one to know <i>it</i>, and he was not able to elude <i>them</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 7:25-30 &amp; Mt 15:22-28 Tyre and Sidon.}</p>
<p>7:25 For* a woman, having heard things concerning him, whose young-daughter had an unclean spirit, came and fell down before his feet. 
7:26 Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she requested of him that* he might cast forth the demon out of her daughter. 
7:27 But Jesus said to her, <b>Allow the children first to be fed; for* it is not good to take the children’s bread and cast it to the puppies.</b></p>
<p>7:28 But she answered and said to him, Yes, Lord; for* even the puppies underneath the table eat of the children’s crumbs.</p>
<p>7:29 And he said to her, <b>Because of these words, go; the demon has come out of your daughter.</b> 
7:30 And she went away to her house and found the child put upon <i>her</i> cot, the demon having gone forth.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>{Mk 
7:31 &amp; Mt 
15:29 Avoiding Herod’s territory.}</p>
<p>7:31 And again, having gone out from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, between the borders of Decapolis.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 7:32-37 &amp; Mt 15:30-31 Magadan and Bethsaida Summer 29 AD.}</p>
<p>7:32 And they bring to him one who had a speaking impaired mute and they plead with him that* he might lay his hand on him. 
7:33 And having taken him away from the crowd privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and he spits, and touched his tongue; 
7:34 and looking up to heaven, he groaned and says to him, <b>Ephphatha.</b> (That is, Be opened.) 
7:35 And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he was speaking correctly. 
7:36 And he ordered them that* they should tell no one, but as many things as he was ordering them <i>not to tell</i>, rather, they were preaching <i>it</i> even-more.</p>
<p>7:37 And they were being abundantly astounded, saying, He has done all things well; he makes* even the deaf to hear, and the mute to speak.</p>
<h3>Mark 8</h3>
<p>{Mk 8:1-
8:9 &amp; Mt 15:32-38.}</p>
<p>8:1 The crowd was enormous in those days, and they do not have anything to eat. Jesus, having called to him his disciples, says to them, 
8:2 <b>I have compassion upon the crowd, because they already remain with me <i>for</i> three days and do not have anything <i>that</i> they might eat.</b> 
8:3  <b>And if I dismiss them starving to their house, they will faint on the road; for* some of them <i>have</i> come from far <i>away</i>.</b></p>
<p>8:4 And his disciples answered him, From where shall anyone be able to feed these <i>men</i> bread here in the wilderness?</p>
<p>8:5 And he asked them, <b>How many loaves do you* have?</b></p>
<p>Now they said, Seven.</p>
<p>8:6 And he commanded the crowd to lean-back upon the soil. And he took the seven loaves, and having given-thanks, he broke <i>them</i> and was giving them to his disciples, that* they might place <i>them</i> beside <i>them</i>, and they placed <i>them</i> beside the crowd. 
8:7 And they were holding a few small-fish, and having given-thanks, he said <i>to his disciples</i> to also place these beside them. 
8:8 Now they ate and were fed, and they took up an abundance of broken pieces– seven baskets. 
8:9 Now those who had eaten were approximately four thousand, and he dismissed them.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 8:10-26 &amp; Mt 15:39-
16:12 Near Caesarea Philippi Summer 29 AD.}</p>
<p>8:10 And immediately he stepped into the ship with his disciples and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</p>
<br>
<p>8:11 And the Pharisees came forth and began to debate together with him, seeking from him a sign from the heaven, testing him. 
8:12 And having groaned deeply in his spirit, he says, <b>Why is this generation seeking a sign? Assuredly I am saying to you*, <i>As</i> if a sign will be given to this generation.</b> 
8:13 And he left them, and again stepping onto a ship, went away to the <i>area</i> beyond-that.</p>
<br>
<p>8:14 And they forgot to take bread, and they did not have <i>any bread,</i> except one loaf in the ship with them. 
8:15 And he ordered them, saying, <b>See that <i>you* are</i> beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.</b></p>
<p>8:16 And they were reasoning with one another, saying, <i>It is</i> because we have no bread.</p>
<p>8:17 And Jesus knew <i>it</i> and says to them, <b>Why are you* reasoning <i>so</i>, because you* have no bread? Do you* still not perceive, nor understand? Do you* still have your* heart hardened?</b> 
8:18 <b>Having eyes, do you* not see? Having ears, do you* not hear? And do you* not remember?</b> 
8:19 <b>When I broke the five loaves *for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you* lift up?</b></p>
<p>They say to him, Twelve.</p>
<p>8:20 <b>Now when the seven to the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you* lift up?</b></p>
<p>Now they said, Seven.</p>
<p>8:21 And he said to them, <b>How do you* not yet understand?</b></p>
<br>
<p>8:22 And he comes to Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man and plead with him that* he might touch him. 
8:23 And grabbing the blind man by the hand, he led him outside the village, and having spit into his eyes and laid his hands upon him, he asked him if he sees anything.</p>
<p>8:24 And he, having looked up, said, I see men, because I behold <i>them</i> like walking trees. 
8:25 Thereafter he laid <i>his</i> hands upon his eyes again, and he made* him to look at <i>him</i>. And he was restored and saw all <i>men</i> distinctly.</p>
<p>8:26 And he sent him away to his house, saying, <b>Neither enter into the village, nor say <i>anything</i> to anyone in the village.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 8:27-30 &amp; Mt 16:13-20 &amp; Lk 9:18-21 Caesarea Philippi.}</p>
<p>8:27 And Jesus went forth and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi, and on the road he asked his disciples, saying to them, <b>Who do men say that I am?</b></p>
<p>8:28 Now they answered, John the Immerser* and others, Elijah, but others, One of the prophets.</p>
<p>8:29 And he asked them, <b>But who do you* say that I am?</b></p>
<p>Now Peter answering, says to him, You are the Christ. 
8:30 And he rebuked them that* they should speak to no one concerning him.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>{Mk 8:31-
9:1 &amp; Mt 16:21-28 &amp; Lk 9:22-27 Caesarea Philippi.}</p>
<p>8:31 And he began to teach them, that it is essential <i>for</i> the Son of Man to suffer many things and to be rejected* by the elders and the high-priests and the scribes, and be killed, and to rise* up after three days. 
8:32 And he was speaking the word frankly. And Peter took him and began to rebuke him. 
8:33 But he turning again, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, <b>Go behind me, adversary, because you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.</b></p>
<p>8:34 And having called the crowd together with his disciples to him, he said to them, <b>Whoever wishes to follow after me, let him deny himself, and lift up his cross and follow me.</b> 
8:35 <b>For* whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life because of me and <i>because</i> of the good-news, this one will save it.</b> 
8:36 <b>For* what will it profit a man, if he has gained the whole world and should forfeit his soul?</b> 
8:37 <b>Or what shall a man give <i>in</i> exchange for his life?</b> 
8:38 <b>For* whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this generation, the adulteress and sinner, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him, whenever he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy messengers.</b> <h3>Mark 9</h3> 
9:1 And he was saying to them, <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, There are some of those standing here, who may never* taste of death, until they should see the kingdom of God having come in power.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 9:2-13 &amp; Mt 17:1-13 &amp; Lk 9:28-36 Caesarea Philippi.}</p>
<p>9:2 And after six days Jesus takes with <i>him</i> Peter and James and John and brings them up alone into a high mountain privately, and he was transfigured before them; 
9:3 and his garments became gleaming, exceedingly white like snow, such-as no launderer upon the earth is able to whiten. 
9:4 And Elijah, together with Moses, appeared to them, and they were speaking together with Jesus.</p>
<p>9:5 And Peter answered and says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here, and we should make* three tabernacles; one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah. 
9:6 For* he did not know what he would {Greek: will} say; for* they were fearful.</p>
<p>9:7 And there became a cloud overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, <b>This is my beloved Son; hear him!</b> 
9:8 And suddenly, having looked around, they saw no one anymore, but only Jesus with themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>9:9 Now <i>while</i> coming down from the mountain, he ordered them that* they should describe to no one what they saw, except whenever the Son of Man rises* up from the dead. 
9:10 And they took-hold of the word for themselves, debating together with <i>themselves</i>, What is the rising* up from the dead? 
9:11 And they asked him, saying, <i>How is it</i> that the scribes say that it is essential <i>for</i> Elijah to come first?</p>
<p>9:12 But he answered and said to them, <b>Elijah indeed comes first and restores all things, and how it has been written of the Son of Man, that* he should suffer many things and should be scorned?</b> 
9:13 <b>But I am saying to you*, that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him as many things as they willed, just-as it has been written of him.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 9:14-29 &amp; Mt 17:14-21 &amp; Lk 9:37-43 Region of Caesarea Philippi.}</p>
<p>9:14 And when* he came <i>back</i> to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and scribes debating together with them. 
9:15 And immediately all the crowd, having seen him, were utterly amazed, and running up to him, they were greeting him. 
9:16 And he asked the scribes,  <b>What are you* debating together with them?</b></p>
<p>9:17 And one out of the crowd answered and said, Teacher, I brought my son to you, who has a mute spirit; 
9:18 and wherever it overtakes him, it rips at him and he foams and grinds his teeth and he is dried up, and I spoke to your disciples that* they might cast it out, and <i>yet</i> they were not strong-enough.</p>
<p>9:19 But he answered and says, <b>O unbelieving generation, until when shall I be with you*? Until when shall I tolerate you*? Bring him to me.</b> 
9:20 And they brought him to him, and when* he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell upon the earth. He was wallowing– foaming. 
9:21 Now he asked his father, <b>How much time has <i>things</i> like this happened to him?</b></p>
<p>And he said, From childhood. 
9:22 And often it has cast him both into fire and into waters, that* it might destroy him, but if you are able <i>to do</i> anything, help us and have compassion upon us.</p>
<p>9:23 Now Jesus said to him, <b>If you are able to believe. All things are possible to him who believes.</b></p>
<p>9:24 And immediately the father of the child cried out with tears and said, I believe; Lord, help <i>me</i> with my unbelief.</p>
<p>9:25 Now when* Jesus saw that a crowd was running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, <b>I command you, mute and deaf spirit, come out of him and enter into him no longer.</b></p>
<p>9:26 And having cried out and convulsed him much, it came out, and <i>the boy</i> became like <i>one</i> dead; so-that many said, He is dead.</p>
<p>9:27 But having taken-hold of him by the hand, Jesus lifted him up, and he stood up. 
9:28 And having entered into the house, his disciples asked him privately, <i>How is it</i> that we were not able to cast it out?</p>
<p>9:29 And he said to them, <b>This variety is not able to come out by anything, except in prayer and fasting.</b></p>
<br>

<p>9:30 And they went forth from there, and were traveling through Galilee, and he did not wish that* anyone should know <i>it</i>. 
9:31 For* he was teaching his disciples and was saying to them, <b>The Son of Man is <i>to be</i> given up into the hands of men, and they will kill him, and having been killed, he will be risen* in the third day.</b> 
9:32 But they were not considering the declaration, and were afraid to ask him.</p>

<p>9:33 And he came to Capernaum, and when* he happened <i>to be</i> in the house he asked them, <b>What were you* reasoning among yourselves by the road?</b> 
9:34 But they were silent; for* they had reasoned with one another on the road, who <i>was</i> greater. 
9:35 And having sat down, he summoned the twelve, and he said to them, <b>If anyone wishes to be first, he will be last of all and servant of all.</b> 
9:36 And having taken a little child, he stood it in the midst of them. And having wrapped it in <i>his</i> arms, he said to them, 
9:37 <b>Whoever accepts one little child of such in my name, accepts me, and whoever accepts me, does not accept me, but he who sent me.</b></p>
<br>
<p>9:38 Now John answered him, saying, Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, who is not following us, and we did forbid him because he is not following us.</p>
<p>9:39 But Jesus said, <b>Do not forbid him; for* there is no one who will do a miracle in my name, and be able to speak evil of me quickly.</b> 
9:40 <b>For* he who is not against you* is <i>working</i> on your* behalf.</b> 
9:41 <b>For* whoever gives you* a cup of water to drink in my name, because you* are of Christ, assuredly I am saying to you*, He may never* lose his reward.</b> 
9:42 <b>And whoever offends one of these little ones who believe in me, it is good for him rather if a mill’s stone encompassed his neck, and he has been cast into the sea.</b></p>
<p>9:43 <b>And if your hand offends you, cut it off. It is good for you to enter into life crippled, <i>rather</i> than having your two hands, <i>and</i> to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire,</b> 
9:44 <b>where a maggot of them is not dead* and the fire is not quenched.</b> 
9:45 <b>And if your foot offends you, cut it off. It is good for you to enter into life lame, <i>rather</i> than having your two feet, <i>and</i> to be cast into hell, into the unquenchable fire,</b> 
9:46 <b>where a maggot is not dead* and the fire is not quenched.</b> 
9:47 <b>And if your eye offends you, cast it out. It is good for you to enter into the kingdom of God one-eyed, <i>rather</i> than having two eyes, <i>and</i> to be cast into the hell of fire,</b> 
9:48 <b>where a maggot of them is not dying and the fire is not quenched.</b> 
9:49 <b>For* everyone will be salted with fire and every sacrifice will be salted with salt.</b>

10:2 And having come to <i>him</i>, the Pharisees asked him, testing him, Is it legal for a man to divorce <i>his</i> wife?</p>
<p>10:3 But he answered and said to them, <b>What did Moses command you*?</b></p>
<p>10:4 But they said, Moses permitted <i>us</i> to write a document of divorcement and to divorce her. {Deu. 24:1}</p>
<p>10:5 And Jesus answered and said to them, <b>He wrote this commandment for you*, for your* hardness of heart.</b>

<p>10:20 But he answered and said to him, Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth.</p>

10:22 But being dismal upon the word, he went away <i>and</i> was sorrowing; for* he had many properties.</p>
<br>
<p>10:23 And Jesus, having looked around, says to his disciples, <b>How those who have wealth will hardly enter into the kingdom of God!</b> 
10:24 Now the disciples were being amazed upon his words. But Jesus again answered and says to them, <b>Children, how hard it is <i>for</i> those who have confidence in wealth to enter into the kingdom of God!</b> 
10:25 <b>It is easier <i>for</i> a camel to enter through a needle’s eye, than <i>for</i> a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</b></p>

<p>10:36 But he said to them, <b>What are you* wishing me to do for you*?</b></p>
<p>10:37 Now they said to him, Give to us that* we may sit, one at your right <i>hand</i> and one at your left <i>hand</i> in your glory.</p>
<p>10:38 But Jesus said to them, <b>You* do not know what you* are asking for yourselves. Are you* able to drink the cup that I am drinking? And to be immersed* in the immersion* that I am immersed* in?</b></p>
<p>10:39 Now they said to him, We are able.</p>
<p>But Jesus said to them, <b>Indeed the cup that I am drinking, you* will drink, and the immersion* that I am immersed* <i>in</i>, you* will be immersed* <i>in</i>.</b> 
10:40 <b>But to sit at my right and at <i>my</i> left is not mine to give, but <i>it is for them</i> for whom it has been prepared.</b> 
10:41 And when* the ten heard it, they began to be indignant concerning James and John.</p>
<br>
<p>10:42 Now having called them to him, Jesus says to them, <b>You* know that those who seem to rule over the Gentiles are lording it over them, and their great ones are wielding authority over them.</b> 
10:43 <b>But it will not be so among you*, but <i>rather,</i> whoever wishes to become great among you* will be your* servant;</b>

10:48 And many were rebuking him, that* he should be silent, but he was crying out much more, Son of David, show-mercy to me.</p>
<p>10:49 And Jesus stood still and asked for him to be summoned.</p>
<p>And they summon the blind man, saying to him, Have courage. Arise; he is summoning you. 
10:50 Now he came to Jesus, having cast away his garment, <i>and</i> having stood up.</p>
<p>10:51 And Jesus answered and says to him, <b>What do you wish <i>that</i> I might do for you?</b></p>
<p>Now the blind <i>man</i> said to him, Rabboni, that* I may recover my sight.</p>

<p>11:5 And some of those who are standing there were saying to them, What are you* doing, loosening the colt?</p>
<p>11:6 And they said to them just-as Jesus had commanded and they let them leave. 
11:7 And they led the colt to Jesus and cast their garments upon it, and he sat upon it. 
11:8 But many spread their garments upon the road, and others were cutting down foliage from the trees and were spreading <i>them</i> in the road. 
11:9 And those who precede <i>him</i> and those who followed <i>him</i>, were crying out, saying, Hosanna; he who comes in the name of the Lord has been blessed.

11:14 And Jesus answered and said to it, <b>No one may eat fruit from you– no longer, forever.</b> And his disciples heard it.</p>
<br>
<p>11:15 And they come to Jerusalem and Jesus entered into the temple and began to cast out those who are selling and buying in the temple, and turned over the tables of the brokers and the chairs of those who are selling the doves;

<p>11:22 And Jesus answered and says to them, <b>Have faith of God.</b>

12:2 <b>And at the <i>harvest</i> time, he sent a bondservant to the farmers, that* he might receive from the fruit of the vineyard from the farmers.</b>

12:14 Now when* they came, they say to him, Teacher, we know that you are true and do not care concerning one<i>’s appearance</i>. You do not look at <i>the</i> countenance of men, but teach the way of God by truth. Is it legal to give tribute to Caesar or not? 
12:15 Should we give or should we not give?</p>
<p>But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, <b>Why are you* testing me? Bring me a denarius</b> {a standard day’s pay}<b>, that* I may see it.</b> 
12:16 Now they brought it. And he says to them, <b>Whose <i>face</i> is this image and inscription?</b></p>

12:22 and the seven took her and left no seed. Last of all the woman also died. 
12:23 In the resurrection, whenever they rise* up, whose wife will she be of them? For* the seven had her <i>as their</i> wife.</p>
<p>12:24 And Jesus answered and said to them, <b>Are you* not <i>being</i> misled because of this, <i>by</i> not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God?</b> 
12:25 <b>For* whenever they will rise* up from the dead, they neither marry, nor are they betrothed, but are like messengers who are in the heavens.</b> 
12:26 <b>But concerning the dead, that they are raised; have you* not read in the book of Moses, at <i>the place concerning</i> the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I <i>am</i> the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'?</b> {Ex. 3:6}

<p>12:28 And one of the scribes came and heard them debating together, and knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, What commandment is the first of all?</p>
<p>12:29 But Jesus answered, <b>The first of all the commandments is: ‘Hear, <i>O</i> Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is one';</b> 
12:30 <b>and ‘You will love* the Lord your God from all your heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.’ This is the first commandment.</b> {Deu. 6:4-6} 
12:31 <b>And the second <i>is</i> similar, ‘You will love* your neighbor like yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater <i>than</i> these.</b> {Lev. 19:18}</p>
<p>12:32 And the scribe said to him, Of a truth, Teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is no other except* he;

<p>14:19 Now they began to be sorrowful and to say to him one by one, It is not I, is it? And another, It is not I, is it?</p>
<p>14:20 But he answered and said to them, <b><i>It is</i> one out of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.</b> 
14:21 <b>The Son of Man indeed is going, just-as it has been written concerning him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is given up! It was</b> {i.e. would be} <b>good for him, if that <i>man</i> was not <i>ever</i> born.</b></p>

14:23 And he took the cup and having given-thanks, he gave <i>it</i> to them, and they all drank out of it. 
14:24 And he said to them, <b>This is my blood, that of the new covenant*, which is poured out concerning many.</b>

<p>. 
14:26 And having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mountain of Olives.</p>
<p>{See Mk 14:18-21 above.}</p>
<p>14:27 And Jesus says to them, <b>All <i>of</i> you* will be offended at me in this night, because it has been written, ‘I will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered.’</b> {Zech. 13:7} 
14:28 <b>But after I arise, I will precede you* into Galilee.</b></p>
<p>14:29 But Peter said to him, Even if all will be offended, but not I.</p>
<p>14:30 And Jesus says to him, <b>Assuredly I am saying to you, that today, <i>even</i> in this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three-times.</b></p>
<p>14:31 But <i>Peter</i> spoke exceptionally, If it should be essential <i>for</i> me to die together with you, I may never* deny you! Now likewise*, they also all were saying <i>it.</i></p>
<p>{See Mk 
14:26 above.}</p>
<p>14:32 And they come to a parcel of ground of which the name <i>is</i> Gethsemane, and he says to his disciples, <b>Sit here until I should pray.</b> 
14:33 And he takes with <i>him</i> Peter and James and John, and began to be utterly amazed and disheartened. 
14:34 And he says to them, <b>My soul is very sorrowful, remain here and watch.</b></p>
<p>14:35 And he went forward a little, and fell upon the earth and was praying that*, if it was possible, the hour might pass away from him. 
14:36 And he said, <b>Abba, Father, all things are possible for you; carry this cup away from me, but not what I will, but what you <i>will</i>.</b></p>
<p>14:37 And he comes and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, <b>Simon, do you sleep? Were you not strong-enough to watch one hour?</b> 
14:38 <b>Watch and pray, that* you* may not enter into temptation. The spirit is indeed eager, but the flesh is weak.</b></p>
<p>14:39 And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.</p>
<p>14:40 And having returned, he found them sleeping again, for* their eyes were heavy, and they did not know what they should answer him.</p>
<p>14:41 And he comes the third-time and says to them,  <b>Furthermore, are you* sleeping and resting yourselves? It is <i>enough</i>. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is given up into the hands of sinners.</b>  
14:42 <b>Arise, we should be going. Behold, he who is giving me up has drawn near.</b></p>

<p>14:43 And immediately, <i>as</i> he is still speaking, Judas, being one of the twelve, comes <i>up</i> and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs from the high-priests, and the scribes and the elders. 
14:44 Now he who is giving him up had given them a predefined gesture, saying, Whomever I kiss, that is he; take-hold of him and securely lead him away. 
14:45 And having come <i>to the place</i>, he went immediately to him and says to him, Rabbi, Rabbi, and kissed him. 
14:46 Now they put hands upon him and took-hold of him.</p>
<p>14:47 But a certain one of those standing beside <i>him</i>, pulled his sword, and struck the bondservant of the high-priest and took off his ear.</p>
<p>14:48 And Jesus answered and said to them, <b>Have you* come out, as against a robber with swords and clubs to take me?</b> 
14:49 <b>I was with you* daily teaching in the temple and you* did not take-hold of me, but <i>this is done</i> in order that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.</b></p>

14:51 And one, a certain young-man followed with him, having been dressed in a linen cloth over <i>his</i> naked <i>body</i>, and the young-men took-hold of him;

<br>
<p>{Mk 14:55-65 &amp; Mt 26:59-68 &amp; Lk 22:63-65.}</p>
<p>14:55 Now the high-priests and the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus, *that* they might slay him, and they were not finding it. 
14:56 For* many were falsely testifying against him, and <i>yet</i> their testimonies were not equal. 
14:57 And some stood up and were falsely testifying against him, saying, 
14:58 We heard him say, I will tear-down this temple, the <i>one</i> made* with hands, and in three days, I will build another not made* with hands. 
14:59 And thus, neither was their testimony equal.</p>
<p>14:60 And the high-priest stood up in <i>the</i> midst <i>of them</i> and asked Jesus, saying, Are you answering nothing? What are these <i>witnesses</i> testifying against you? 
14:61 But he was silent and answered nothing. Again the high-priest asked him and said to him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Gracious* <i>One</i>?</p>
<p>14:62 But Jesus said, <b>I am, and you* will see the Son of Man sitting at the right <i>hand</i> of power and coming with the clouds of heaven.</b></p>
<br>
<p>14:63 But the high-priest ripped his tunic and says, Why do we still have need of witnesses? 
14:64 You* have heard the blasphemy. What does it appear to you*? Now they all condemned him to be liable for death. 
14:65 And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to batter him, and to say to him, Prophesy! And the attendants were casting him <i>around</i> with slaps on the cheek.</p>

<p>14:66 And Peter being below in the courtyard, <i>there</i> one of the maidservants of the high-priest comes; 
14:67 and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and says, You were also with Jesus, the Nazarene.</p>
<p>14:68 But he denied <i>it</i>, saying, I neither know <i>him</i>, nor even know what you are saying, and he went outside to the forecourt, and the rooster crowed.</p>
<p>14:69 And the maidservant saw him and began again to say to those standing beside <i>her</i>, This <i>one</i> is from them. 
14:70 But he again was denying it. And after a little <i>while</i>, those standing beside <i>them</i> were again saying to Peter, You truly are from them; for you are a Galilean and your speech is similar.</p>
<p>14:71 But he began to curse and swear, I do not know this man of whom you* speak. 
14:72 And the rooster crowed the second-time. And Peter was reminded of the declaration that Jesus said to him, <b>Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three-times.</b> And having put <i>his thoughts</i> on <i>it</i>, he wept.</p>

<p>15:1 And immediately in the morning, the high-priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole <i>ruling</i> council, made* a council <i>together</i> and bound Jesus and carried him away and gave him up to Pilate.</p>

<p>{Mt 27:3-10 &amp; Acts 1:18-19 Friday morning and toward the future.}</p>

<p>15:2 And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews?</p>
<p>But he answered and said to him, <b>You speak <i>correctly</i>.</b></p>
<p>15:3 And the high-priests were accusing him of many things, {T} <i>but He answered nothing</i>.</p>
<p>15:4 But Pilate asked him again, saying, Do you answer nothing? Behold how many things they are testifying against you. 
15:5 But Jesus no more answered anything; so-that Pilate marveled.</p>

<p>15:6 Now he <i>normally</i> released to them one prisoner at <i>the</i> feast, whomever they asked <i>for</i>. 
15:7 Now there was one called* Barabbas, having been bound with his fellow rioters, who in the riot had practiced murder. 
15:8 And the crowd crying out, began to ask <i>him to do</i> like he was doing habitually for them. 
15:9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Do you* wish that I might release to you* the King of the Jews? 
15:10 For* he has known that the high-priests had given him up because of envy. 
15:11 But the high-priests shook up the crowd, that* he should rather release Barabbas to them. 
15:12 And Pilate again answered and said to them, Then* what do you* wish that I might do to him whom you* call* <i>the</i> King of the Jews?</p>
<p>15:13 But they cried out again, Crucify him!</p>
<p>15:14 But Pilate said to them, For* what evil has he done?</p>
<p>But they cried out even-more, Crucify him. 
15:15 Now Pilate, willing to do what <i>was</i> sufficient for the crowd, released to them Barabbas and gave up Jesus, having scourged him, that* he might be crucified.</p>
<p>15:16 Now the soldiers led him away, inside the courtyard, which is the palace, and they call together the whole cohort {600 soldiers}. 
15:17 And they clothe him with purple, and braided a thorny crown, <i>and</i> they placed it around his <i>head</i>; 
15:18 and they began to greet him, Hail, King of the Jews! 
15:19 And they were beating his head with a reed and were spitting on him, and placing the knees <i>down</i>, they were worshiping him.</p>

15:21 And they compel a certain one passing by, Simon from Cyrene, coming from the rural-area, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go <i>with them</i>, that* he might lift up his cross. 
15:22 And they bring him to the place <i>called</i> Golgotha, which is, <i>after</i> being translated, The place of a skull. 
15:23 And they were giving to him wine to drink, having been medicated with myrrh, but he did not take it.</p>

<p>15:24 And having crucified him, ‘they divide his garments, casting a lot upon them,’ who <i>and</i> what <i>each</i> might take. {Psa 22:18} 
15:25 Now it was the third hour {i.e. 
9:00 AM} and they crucified him. 
15:26 And the inscription of his accusation was written on <i>the cross</i>, The King of the Jews. 
15:27 And they crucify two robbers together with him; one at his right and one at his left. 
15:28 And the Scripture was fulfilled, which says ‘And he was counted with <i>the</i> lawless.’ {Isa 53:12} 
15:29 ‘And those who traveled by were blaspheming him, wagging their heads’ and saying, Ha! You who <i>will</i> tear-down the temple and build <i>it</i> in three days; 
15:30 ‘save yourself and come down from the cross.’ {Psa 22:7}</p>
<p>15:31 Now likewise, the high-priests with the scribes <i>were</i> mocking <i>him</i> with one another, <i>and</i> were saying, He saved others<i>, but</i> he is not able to save himself. 
15:32 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that* we may see and may believe in him. And those who have been crucified together with him were reproaching him.</p>

<p>15:34 And in the ninth hour {i.e. 
3:00 PM} Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <b>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</b> which is, <i>after</i> being translated, ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ {Psa 22:1}</p>
<p>15:35 And some of those standing beside <i>him</i>, having heard it, were saying, Behold, he is summoning Elijah. 
15:36 But one having run and filled a sponge with vinegar, placed it around a reed and was giving <i>it to</i> him to drink, saying, Allow <i>it, that</i> we may see if Elijah comes to take him down.</p>
<p>15:37 But Jesus expired, having left <i>with</i> a loud voice. 
15:38 And the curtain of the temple was split-apart, into two <i>pieces</i>, from the top to the bottom. 
15:39 Now the centurion* standing <i>there</i>, opposite from him, saw that he thus cried out and expired, said, Truly this man was <i>the</i> Son of God. 
15:40 Now there were also women viewing from afar, among whom were both Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the little {Or: least} and of Joses and Salome;

15:43 Joseph, a prominent counselor, came, who was from Arimathaea, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God, and being daring, he entered to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 
15:44 Now Pilate marveled if he had already died. And calling to him the centurion*, he asked him if he had been dead very-long. 
15:45 And when* he knew it from the centurion*, he bestowed as a gift the body to Joseph. 
15:46 And having bought a linen cloth and having taken him down, he coiled him in the linen cloth, and placed him in a tomb which was hewed out of a rock, and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. 
15:47 Now Mary the Magdalene and Mary the <i>mother</i> of Joses were viewing where he is laid.</p>

16:2 And exceedingly <i>early</i> in the morning on the first <i>day</i> of the week, they are coming upon the tomb when* the sun had risen. 
16:3 And they were saying to themselves, Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us? 
16:4 And looking up, they view that the stone has been rolled away; for* it was extremely great. 
16:5 And entering into the tomb, they saw a young-man sitting at <i>the</i> right <i>side</i>, having been dressed in a white robe, and they were utterly amazed.</p>
<p>16:6 Now he says to them, Do not be utterly amazed. You* are seeking Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He was raised. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him. 
16:7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He precedes you* into Galilee. You* will see him there, like he said to you*. 
16:8 And they went out and fled from the tomb. Now trembling and astonishment were holding them, and they said nothing to anyone; for* they were afraid.</p>

16:10 Having gone-onward, that <i>woman</i> reported to those who had come* <i>to be</i> with him, <i>who were</i> mourning and weeping.

<h3>Luke 1</h3>
<p>{Lk 1:1-4 Introduction; no parallel.}</p>
<p>1:1 Since many have undertaken <i>the task</i> to compile a narrative concerning the matters which have been fully assured among us, 
1:2 just-as they gave them to us, who from the beginning became eyewitnesses and attendants of the word, 
1:3 it also seemed <i>good</i> to me, having followed accurately in all things from the start, to write to you afterwards, most-excellent Theophilus; 
1:4 that* you might fully know the certainty concerning the words in which you were instructed.</p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 1:5-25 Jerusalem 6 BC; no parallel.}</p>
<p>1:5 It happened in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, <i>there was</i> a certain priest, Zacharias by name, from the class* of Abijah and he had a wife of the daughters from Aaron and her name was Elisabeth. 
1:6 Now they were both righteous <i>and</i> blameless in God’s sight, conducting-themselves in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. 
1:7 And there was no child to them, insomuch as Elisabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in their days.</p>
<br>
<p>1:8 Now it happened, while* he was doing priestly duties in front of God in the order of his class*, 
1:9 according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn-incense. 
1:10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside in the hour of incense. 
1:11 And a messenger of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right <i>side</i> of <i>the</i> altar of incense. 
1:12 And Zacharias was disturbed, seeing <i>him</i> and fear fell upon him.</p>
<p>1:13 But the messenger said to him, Do not fear, Zacharias, because your supplication is heard and your wife Elisabeth will give-birth to a son to you and you will call his name John. 
1:14 And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. 
1:15 For* he will be great in the Lord’s sight, and he may never* drink wine or liquor, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. 
1:16 And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God. 
1:17 And he will go beforehand, in his sight, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to return the hearts of the fathers <i>back</i> on <i>their</i> children, and the disobedient <i>to return</i> in the prudence of the righteous; to make-ready a prepared people for <i>the</i> Lord.</p>
<p>1:18 And Zacharias said to the messenger, According to what, shall I know this? For* I am an elderly-man and my wife is advanced in her days.</p>
<p>1:19 And the messenger answered and said to him, I am Gabriel, who stands in God’s sight, and I was sent to speak to you and to proclaim to you this good-news. 
1:20 And behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, till the day that these things should happen, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.</p>
<p>1:21 And the people were expecting Zacharias and they were marveling at his delaying in the temple. 
1:22 But when* he came out, he was not able to speak to them, and they recognized that he had seen a vision in the temple, and he was signaling to them and was remaining mute. 
1:23 And it happened, as the days of his ministry* were fulfilled, he went away to his house.</p>
<br>
<p>1:24 Now after these days, Elisabeth his wife conceived, and she was hiding herself <i>for</i> five months, saying, 
1:25 Thus the Lord has done to me in the days in which he looked upon <i>me</i>, to take away my reproach among men.</p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 1:26-38 Nazareth 5 BC; no parallel.}</p>
<p>1:26 Now in the sixth month Gabriel the messenger was sent by God to a city of Galilee, whose name <i>was</i> Nazareth, 
1:27 to a virgin who has been engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, from the house of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary. 
1:28 And the messenger coming to her, said, Hail! She who has been favored. The Lord <i>is</i> with you. You have been blessed among women. 
1:29 But she seeing him, was <i>very</i> disturbed at his speech, and was reasoning what sort of greeting this might be. 
1:30 And the messenger said to her, Do not fear, Mary; for* you have found favor with God. 
1:31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and will bear a son and will call his name Jesus. 
1:32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Highest and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, 
1:33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end of his kingdom.</p>
<p>1:34 But Mary said to the messenger, How will this be, since I do not know a man?</p>
<p>1:35 And the messenger answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; hence the holy thing being born out of you will also be called the Son of God. 
1:36 And behold, Elisabeth your relative, she also has conceived a son in her elderliness, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren, 
1:37 because no declaration from God will be powerless.</p>
<p>1:38 But Mary said, Behold, the bondservant of the Lord; let it happen to me according to your declaration. And the messenger went away from her.</p>
<p>{Lk 1:39-80 Hill region of Judea, 5 BC; no parallel.}</p>
<p>1:39 Now rising* up in these days, Mary traveled diligently into the hill-country, into a city of Judah; 
1:40 and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elisabeth. 
1:41 And it happened, as Elisabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby jumped in her womb, and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit; 
1:42 and she shouted out with a loud voice and said, You have been blessed among women, and the fruit of your womb has been blessed. 
1:43 And from where, is this to me, that* the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
1:44 For* behold, as the voice of your greeting came* into my ears, the baby jumped in my womb in gladness. 
1:45 And she who believed is fortunate, because there will be a completion of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord.</p>
<p>1:46 And Mary said, My soul extols the Lord, 
1:47 and my spirit was glad in God my Savior. 
1:48 Because he has looked upon the humbleness of his bondservant; for* behold, from hereafter all generations will esteem me fortunate. 
1:49 Because he who is mighty has done great things to me. And holy is his name. 
1:50 And his mercy is toward generations of generations to those who fear him. 
1:51 He has made* <i>his</i> dominion <i>known</i> with* his arm. He has scattered the haughty in <i>the</i> perception of their heart. 
1:52 He has taken down sovereigns from <i>their</i> thrones and has exalted <i>the</i> humble. 
1:53 He has filled <i>the</i> hungry with good things, and he has sent the rich away empty. 
1:54 He helped Israel his young-servant, <i>in order</i> to remember his mercy, 
1:55 just-as he spoke to our fathers, toward Abraham and his seed forever.</p>
<br>
<p>1:56 Now Mary remained together with her approximately three months and returned to her house.</p>
<br>
<p>1:57 Now Elisabeth’s time was fulfilled that she should bear, and she gave-birth to a son. 
1:58 And the dwellers around <i>her,</i> and her relatives, heard that the Lord was magnifying his mercy with her, and they were rejoicing together with her. 
1:59 And it happened, that on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child, and they were <i>to be</i> calling it upon {i.e. after} the name of his father, Zacharias. 
1:60 And his mother answered and said, Not so, but he will be called John.</p>
<p>1:61 And they said to her, There is none among your relatives who is called by this name. 
1:62 But they were signaling to his father, what he might wish him to be called. 
1:63 And he asked for a writing-tablet and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marveled. 
1:64 Now his mouth was instantly opened, and his tongue <i>loosed,</i> and he was speaking, thanking God. 
1:65 And fear became upon all those dwelling around them and all these declarations were being talked-about in the whole hill-country of Judea. 
1:66 And all who heard them placed them in their heart, saying, What then will this child be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>
<p>1:67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying, 
1:68 The Lord, the God of Israel <i>is</i> gracious*. Because he has visited and made* redemption for his people, 
1:69 and has lifted up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his young-servant David, 
1:70 (just-as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from the ages <i>past</i>). 
1:71 <i>We have</i> salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us; 
1:72 to do <i>his</i> mercy with our fathers and to remember his holy covenant*. 
1:73 <i>We have</i> the oath which he swore to Abraham our father to give to us, 
1:74 fearlessly being rescued out of the hand of our enemies, <i>that</i> we should give-divine service to him 
1:75 in holiness and righteousness all the days of <i>our</i> life in his sight. 
1:76 And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest; for* ‘you will travel before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways.’ {Mal. 3:1} 
1:77 <i>You are</i> to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins, 
1:78 through the heart* of mercy of our God, in which the rising <i>of light</i> from on high has visited us, 
1:79 to appear upon those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; to steer our feet into the way of peace.</p>
<br>
<p>1:80 Now the child was growing and becoming-powerful in spirit and was in the wildernesses until the day of his <i>public</i> showing to Israel.</p>
<h3>Luke 2</h3>
<p>{Lk 2:1-20 Bethlehem 5 BC; no parallel.}</p>
<p>{Augustus, a title, both the Latin form and Greek word ‘sebastos’ are in the Bible (G828, G4575), which are adjectives that means ‘worthy of worship. It is like our Reverend, His Majesty, Your Worship, etc.’ This ‘worthy of worship’ became worse as more and more Emperors took the throne. Even Nero is referred to as the ‘Man of Sin’ in 2Th 2:3. Caesar is our ‘Emperor.’ Adjectives in Greek occur after the noun so by rights this is His Reverend Emperor in Lk 2:1. In Acts 25:2, 5; 
27:1 - Augustus here means simply ‘the Emperor’ and translated as such.}</p>
<p>2:1 Now it happened in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to register all the inhabited-earth. 
2:2 This first census happened when* Quirinius was governor of Syria. 
2:3 And all were traveling to register themselves, each one into his own city. 
2:4 Now Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was out of the house and family of David; 
2:5 to register himself together with Mary, who has been engaged to him <i>as his</i> wife, being pregnant*. 
2:6 Now it happened, while* they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should bear; 
2:7 and she bore her firstborn son, and she swaddled and laid him in the manger, because there was no place for them in the boarding-house.</p>
<br>
<p>2:8 And there were shepherds in the same region, camping out and observing watches over their flock by night. 
2:9 And behold, a messenger of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were very afraid. 
2:10 And the messenger said to them, Do not be afraid; for* behold, I proclaim to you* good-news of great joy which will be to all the people, 
2:11 because there was born to you* today in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 
2:12 And this <i>is</i> the sign to you*: you* will find a swaddled baby, laying in a manger. 
2:13 And suddenly, a multitude of the heavenly army praising God happened <i>to be</i> together with the messenger, and saying, 
2:14 Glory to God in the highest, and peace upon earth, in men– delight. 
2:15 And it happened, as the messengers went away from them into heaven, and the men, the shepherds, said to one another, We should go through, as far as Bethlehem, and let us see this declaration <i>about events</i> that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us!</p>
<p>2:16 And they came, having hurried, and found both Mary and Joseph and the baby laying in the manger. 
2:17 Now having seen <i>this</i>, they made <i>it</i> known concerning the declaration which was spoken to them concerning this child. 
2:18 And all who heard it marveled concerning the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds. 
2:19 But Mary was keeping all these words to herself, pondering them in her heart. 
2:20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God in all the things that they had heard and seen, just-as it was spoken to them.</p>
<p>{Lk 2:21-39a Temple at Jerusalem 4 BC; no parallel.}</p>
<p>2:21 And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called Jesus, which was so called by the messenger before he was conceived in the womb.</p>
<br>
<p>2:22 And when the days of her cleansing according to the Law of Moses were fulfilled, they led him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord {Lev. 
12:2 - 6} 
2:23 (as it has been written in the Law of the Lord, ‘Every male who opens the womb will be called holy to the Lord’); {Ex. 13:2, 12} 
2:24 and to give ‘A couple of turtledoves or two young doves <i>as</i> a sacrifice according to what has been spoken in the Law of the Lord. {Lev. 12:8, 5:11}</p>
<p>2:25 And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Spirit was upon him. 
2:26 And it was divinely-spoken to him from the Holy Spirit, <i>that</i> he should not see death, before he should see the Lord’s Christ. 
2:27 And he came in the Spirit into the temple while* the parents brought* in the child Jesus, that they might do according to the custom of the law concerning him. 
2:28 Then he accepted him into his arms and thanked God and said, 
2:29 Now Master, dismiss your bondservant according to your word in peace, 
2:30 because my eyes have seen your salvation 
2:31 which you have prepared in the face of all peoples. 
2:32 <i>He is</i> a light *for revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel.</p>
<p>2:33 And Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him; 
2:34 and Simeon gave-thanks for them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this <i>child</i> is destined *for the fall and the resurrection of many in Israel, and *for a sign which is spoken against. 
2:35 Now, also a sword will go through your own soul; *that reasonings may be revealed out of many hearts.</p>
<p>2:36 And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, out of the tribe of Asher (she had advanced in many days, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity, 
2:37 and she <i>had been</i> a widow approximately eighty four years), who did not withdraw from the temple, giving-divine service with fasts and supplications night and day. 
2:38 And standing up in that same hour, she was fully-professing the Lord and was speaking concerning him to all those who were waiting for the redemption in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>{Mt 2:19-23 &amp; Lk 2:39b Egypt &amp; Nazareth 4 BC.}</p>
<p>2:39 And as they <i>had</i> completed all things that were according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 2:40-52 Nazareth and Jerusalem 7 or 8 AD.}</p>
<p>2:40 Now the child was growing and becoming-powerful in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</p>
<br>
<p>2:41 And his parents were traveling yearly to Jerusalem to the feast of the Passover. 
2:42 And when he became twelve years <i>old</i>, they went up to Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast; 
2:43 and having completed the days, while* they were returning, the boy Jesus remained back in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother did not know <i>it</i>. 
2:44 But supposing him to be in the caravan, they went a day’s journey, and they were seeking him among their relatives and among their acquaintances. 
2:45 And having not found him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking after him.</p>
<p>2:46 And it happened, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and asking them <i>questions</i>. 
2:47 Now all who heard him were astonished at his intelligence and his answers. 
2:48 And when* they saw him, they were astounded, and his mother said to him, Son, why have you done so to us? Behold, your father and I were seeking you, sorrowing.</p>
<p>2:49 And he said to them, <b>Why <i>is it</i> that you* were seeking me? Did you* not know it is essential <i>for</i> me to be in the <i>things</i> of my father?</b> 
2:50 And they did not understand the declaration which he spoke to them. 
2:51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and he was being subject to them and his mother was keeping all these words in her heart.</p>
<br>
<p>2:52 And Jesus was progressing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</p>
<h3>Luke 3</h3>
<p>{Mk 1:1-8 &amp; Mt 3:1-12 &amp; Lk 3:1-18. Judea near Jordan River 25 or 26 AD.}</p>
<p>3:1 Now in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being Tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip, Tetrarch of <i>the</i> region <i>made up</i> of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias <i>being</i> Tetrarch of Abilene, 
3:2 in <i>the time</i> of Annas and Caiaphas, <i>the</i> high-priests, <i>the</i> declaration of God came* to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. 
3:3 And he came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching <i>the</i> immersion* of repentance toward <i>the</i> forgiveness of sins; 
3:4 as it has been written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, ‘The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord. Make* his paths straight. 
3:5 Every valley will be filled and every mountain and hill will be humbled. And the crooked will become straight and the rough ways, smooth. 
3:6 And all flesh will see the salvation of God.’ {Isa 40:3-5}</p>
<br>
<p>3:7 Therefore, he was saying to the crowds that traveled out to be immersed* by him, Offspring of vipers! Who warned you* to flee from the future wrath? 
3:8 Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance and do not begin to say in yourselves, We have Abraham *for our father; for* I say to you*, that God is able to lift <i>up</i> children to Abraham from these stones. 
3:9 Now the ax is also already destined *for the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree which is not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</p>
<p>3:10 And the crowds asked him, saying, Then* what shall we do?</p>
<p>3:11 But he answered and said to them, He who has two tunics, let him give <i>one</i> to him who has none, and he who has food, let him do likewise.</p>
<p>3:12 Now tax collectors also came to be immersed*, and they said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?</p>
<p>3:13 Now he said to them, Appropriate no more than what has been appointed for you*.</p>
<p>3:14 But <i>the</i> active soldiers were also asking him, saying, And we, what shall we do?</p>
<p>And he said to them, Intimidate no one, nor cheat <i>anyone</i>, and be content with your* rations.</p>
<br>
<p>3:15 But the people <i>are</i> expecting, and all are reasoning in their hearts concerning John, maybe, he might be the Christ; 
3:16 John answered, saying to them all, I indeed immerse* you* in water, but he who is mightier <i>than</i> I is coming, the strap of whose shoes I am not sufficient to loose. He will immerse* you* in the Holy Spirit, and with fire; 
3:17 whose winnowing fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the grain into his barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.</p>
<br>
<p>3:18 Therefore indeed, encouraging also with many other things, he was proclaiming the good-news to the people.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:14a &amp; Mt 
4:12 &amp; Lk 3:19-20 &amp; Jn 4:1-4 Judea to Galilee.}</p>
<p>3:19 But Herod the Tetrarch, being reproved by him concerning Herodias his brother’s wife and concerning all the evil things which Herod had done, 
3:20 also added this to them all, and he locked up John in the prison.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:9-11 &amp; Mt 3:13-17 Lk 3:21-22 Jordan east of Jericho, Spring 27 AD.}</p>
<p>3:21 Now it happened, while* all the people were immersed*; when* Jesus also was immersed*, and <i>while</i> praying, the heaven was opened, 
3:22 and the Holy Spirit came down in bodily form, like a dove upon him, and a voice came* from heaven, saying, <b>You are my beloved Son. I am delighted in you.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 1:1-17 &amp; Lk 3:23-28 Genealogy.}</p>
<p>3:23 And he was approximately thirty years <i>old, when</i> beginning <i>to teach</i>, (as it was supposed, the son of Joseph). <i>Although</i> Jesus, himself was <i>a descendant</i> from Heli, 
3:24 from Matthat, from Levi, from Melchi, from Jannai, from Joseph, 
3:25 from Mattathias, from Amos, from Nahum, from Esli, from Naggai,

<p>4:1 Now full of the Holy Spirit, Jesus returned from the Jordan, and was being led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 
4:2 being tempted by the Devil <i>for</i> forty days. And he ate nothing in those days, and being completed, later he hungered. 
4:3 And the Devil said to him, If you are the Son of God, speak to this stone that* it may become bread.</p>
<p>4:4 And Jesus answered to him, saying, <b>It has been written, ‘Man will not live on bread only, but upon every declaration from God.’</b> {Deu. 8:3}</p>
<p>4:5 And the Devil, leading him up into a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited-earth in an instant of time. 
4:6 And the Devil said to him, I will give all this authority, and the glory of them, to you, because it has been given to me, and to whomever I wish <i>it</i>; I give <i>it</i>. 
4:7 Therefore, if you worship <i>only</i> in my sight, all <i>this</i> will be yours.</p>
<p>4:8 And Jesus answered and said to him, <b>Go behind me, Adversary! It has been written, ‘You will worship the Lord your God and you will give-divine service to him only.’</b> {Deu. 6:13}</p>
<p>4:9 And he led him to Jerusalem, and stood him upon the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself downward from here. 
4:10 For* it has been written, ‘He will command his messengers concerning you, to guard you,’ 
4:11 and, ‘They will lift you up upon <i>their</i> hands, lest you might hit your foot against a stone.’ {Psa 91:11-12}</p>
<p>4:12 And Jesus answered and said to him, <b>It has been spoken, ‘Do not test the Lord your God.’</b> {Deu. 6:16}</p>
<p>4:13 And when* the Devil <i>had</i> completed every temptation, he withdrew from him till <i>another</i> time.</p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 4:14a &amp; Jn 4:44-45 Arrival in Galilee.}</p>

<br>
<p>{Mk 1:14b-15 &amp; Mt 
4:17 &amp; Lk 4:14b-15.}</p>
<p>And fame went out throughout the whole region around <i>there</i> concerning him. 
4:15 And he was teaching in their synagogues, being glorified by all.</p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 4:16-31; no parallel.}</p>
<p>4:16 And he came to Nazareth, where he was reared up, and according to his custom, he entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read. 
4:17 And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. And having unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, 
4:18 <b>‘The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, in that, he anointed me to proclaim the good-news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the crushed in heart, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send forth the downtrodden in deliverance,</b> 
4:19 <b>to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.’</b> {Isa 61:1-2} 
4:20 And having furled the scroll and giving it back to the attendant, he sat down, and the eyes of all were staring at him in the synagogue. 
4:21 But he began to say to them, <b>This Scripture has been fulfilled today in your* ears.</b></p>
<p>4:22 And all were testifying of him, and were marveling at the words of grace which traveled from his mouth, and they were saying, Is this not Joseph’s son?</p>
<p>4:23 And he said to them, <b>You* will certainly say this parable to me, Physician, heal yourself. We have heard how much had happened in Capernaum, do <i>it</i> here also in your fatherland.</b> 
4:24 But he said, <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, No prophet is acceptable in his fatherland.</b> 
4:25 <b>But in truth I say to you*, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was locked <i>for</i> three years and six months, as <i>such</i> there became a large famine over all the land;</b> 
4:26 <b>and Elijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.</b> 
4:27 <b>And there were many lepers in Israel in <i>the time</i> of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian.</b></p>
<p>4:28 And they were all filled with fury in the synagogue, <i>while</i> hearing these things; 
4:29 and they rose* up and cast him forth outside the city, and led him to the brow of the mountain on which their city had been built, *that* they might propel him off the cliff. 
4:30 But going through the middle of them, he was traveling <i>away</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:21-28 &amp; Lk 4:31-37 Capernaum.}</p>
<p>4:31 And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath day; 
4:32 and they were being astounded at his teaching, because his word was with* authority. 
4:33 And a man was in the synagogue, who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, 
4:34 saying, Ah! What <i>is it</i> to us and to you, Jesus <i>the</i> Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you, who you are, the Holy One of God.</p>
<p>4:35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, <b>Hush and come forth out of him.</b> And when* the demon had tossed him down in the middle <i>of them</i>, he came out of him, having done him no harm.</p>
<p>4:36 And amazement came* upon all, and they were speaking together with one another, saying, What <i>is</i> this word, because he commands the unclean spirits with* authority and power, and they come out? 
4:37 And a rumor was traveling out concerning him, into every place of the region around.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:29-34 &amp; Mt 8:14-17 &amp; Lk 4:38-41 Capernaum.}</p>
<p>4:38 Now he rose* up from the synagogue and entered into the house of Simon. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was being held by a great fever, and they asked him concerning her. 
4:39 And he stood above her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and instantly, she rose* up and was serving them.</p>
<br>
<p>4:40 Now <i>at the</i> setting of the sun, all, as many as had anyone sick with various diseases led them toward him, and having laid his hands on each one of them, healed them. 
4:41 Now demons were also coming out from many, crying out and saying, You are the Christ, the Son of God. And rebuking them, he was not permitting them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:35-39 &amp; Mt 4:23-25 &amp; Lk 4:42-44 Preaching through Galilee.}</p>
<p>4:42 Now when* it became day, he came out and traveled into a desolate place, and the crowds were seeking him and came to him, and were holding-onto him to not travel away from them. 
4:43 But he said to them, <b>It is essential <i>for</i> me to also proclaim the good-news of the kingdom of God to the other cities, because I have been sent to this <i>end</i>.</b></p>
<p>4:44 And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.</p>

<p>5:1 Now it happened, while* the crowd jammed against him to hear the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret; 
5:2 and he saw two ships standing <i>empty</i> by the lake, but the fishermen, having stepped away from them, were rinsing their nets. 
5:3 Now he stepped onto one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and asked him to set-sail a few <i>feet</i> from the land. And he sat down and was teaching the crowds out of the ship. 
5:4 Now as he ceased speaking, he said to Simon, <b>Set-sail into the deep and lower your* nets *for a catch.</b></p>
<p>5:5 And Simon answered and said to him, Master*, we labored through the whole night and took nothing, but at your declaration I will lower the net. 
5:6 And having done this, they locked up together a large multitude of fish, and their net was ripping; 
5:7 and they signaled to their companions, those in the other ship, that they should come to help them. And they came and filled both the ships, so-that they <i>are about</i> to be submerged. 
5:8 But Simon Peter, when* he saw it, fell down before Jesus’ knees, saying, Go away from me, because I am a man, <i>who is</i> a sinner, O Lord. 
5:9 For* amazement engulfed him and all those together with him, at the catch of the fish which they took <i>in</i>; 
5:10 and likewise also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.</p>
<p>And Jesus said to Simon, <b>Do not fear; hereafter you will be catching live men.</b> 
5:11 And having brought* their ships to land, they left all and followed him.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 1:40-45 &amp; Mt 8:2-4 &amp; Lk 5:12-16.}</p>
<p>5:12 And it happened, while* he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy, and seeing Jesus and falling upon his face, he besought of him, saying, Lord, if you are willing, you are able to cleanse me.</p>
<p>5:13 And he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, <b>I am willing; be cleansed.</b> And immediately the leprosy went away from him. 
5:14 And he commanded him to tell no one, <i>saying</i>, <b>But when* you go away, show yourself to the priest and offer <i>the gift</i> concerning your cleansing, just-as Moses commanded, *for a testimony to them.</b> {Lev. 
13:49 and 14:2-4}</p>
<p>5:15 But the word concerning him was going through <i>the land even</i> more, and large crowds were coming together to hear and to be healed by him from their sicknesses. 
5:16 But he was departing by himself in the wilderness and prayed.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>{Mk 2:1-12 &amp; Mt 9:2-8 &amp; Lk 5:17-26.}</p>
<p>5:17 And it happened on one of those days, that he was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem, and the power of <i>the</i> Lord was <i>there</i>, *that* he might heal them.</p>
<p>5:18 And behold, <i>some</i> men are carrying a man who was paralyzed upon a cot, and they were seeking to bring him in and to place him in his sight. 
5:19 And not finding from what <i>way, that</i> they might bring him in because of the crowd, they went up to the housetop and dropped him down through the tiles together with his cot, into the middle, before Jesus. 
5:20 And seeing their faith, he said to him, <b>Man, your sins have been forgiven you.</b></p>
<p>5:21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who is speaking blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins, except God only?</p>
<p>5:22 But Jesus fully knowing their reasonings, answered and said to them, <b>What are you* reasoning in your* hearts?</b> 
5:23 <b>Which is easier, to say, Your sins have been forgiven you; or to say, Arise and walk?</b> 
5:24 <b>But in order that you* may know that the Son of Man has authority upon the earth to forgive sins,</b> (he said to him who has been paralyzed), <b>I say to you, Arise and lift up your cot and travel to your house.</b> 
5:25 And instantly he stood up in their sight, and lifted up <i>that</i> upon which he had been laying, and went away to his house, glorifying God.</p>
<p>5:26 And astonishment took all and they were glorifying God, and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen glorious things today.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 2:13-14 &amp; Mt 
9:9 &amp; Lk 5:27-28 At or near Capernaum.}</p>
<p>5:27 And after these things, he went forth and saw a tax collector, Levi by name, sitting at the tax-office and said to him, <b>Follow me.</b> 
5:28 And having left all, he stood up and followed him.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 2:15-22 &amp; Mt 9:10-17 &amp; Lk 5:29-39 Capernaum.}</p>
<p>5:29 And Levi made* for himself a large banquet in his house and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining <i>at the meal</i> with them. 
5:30 And the Pharisees and their scribes were murmuring to his disciples, saying, Why do you* eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?</p>
<p>5:31 And Jesus answered and said to them, <b>Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.</b> 
5:32 <b>I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.</b></p>
<p>5:33 But they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast frequently and are making* supplications; likewise also the <i>disciples</i> of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?</p>
<p>5:34 But he said to them, <b>The sons of the bridal-party</b>  {companions or guests<b>} are not able to make <i>themselves</i> fast, inasmuch as the bridegroom is with them, are they?</b> 
5:35 <b>But the days will come, whenever the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.</b></p>
<p>5:36 But he also spoke a parable to them: <b>No one puts a patch from a new garment upon an old garment; otherwise, the new <i>and old</i> will split-apart and also the <i>patch</i> from the new will not agree together with the old.</b> 
5:37 <b>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the <i>old</i> wineskins, and it will be poured out and the wineskins will be destroyed.</b> 
5:38 <b>But new wine is put into new wineskins, and both are protected together.</b> 
5:39 <b>And no one having drunk old <i>wine</i>, immediately wishes <i>for</i> new; for* he says, The old is smoother.</b></p>
<h3>Luke 6</h3>
<p>{Mk 2:23-28 &amp; Mt 12:1-8 &amp; Lk 6:1-5 Jerusalem to Galilee.}</p>
<p>6:1 Now it happened on a second Sabbath <i>after the</i> first, that he was traveling through the grainfields, and his disciples were plucking the tops, rubbing them in their hands and were eating <i>them</i>. 
6:2 But some of the Pharisees said to them, Why are you* doing what is not legal to practice on the Sabbaths?</p>
<p>6:3 And Jesus answered and said to them, <b>Have you* not read even this, what David did, when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?</b> 
6:4 <b>How he entered into the house of God and took and ate the showbread, and also gave <i>it</i> to those who were with him; which it is not legal to eat, except for the priests only?</b> {1Sam. 21:6} 
6:5 And he said to them, <b>The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 3:1-6 &amp; Mt 12:9-14 &amp; Lk 6:6-11 Probably Galilee.}</p>
<p>6:6 Now it happened on a different Sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught, and a man was there, and his right <i>hand</i> was dried up. 
6:7 Now the scribes and the Pharisees were observing <i>him</i>, if he will heal <i>him</i> on the Sabbath; that* they might find an accusation <i>against</i> him. 
6:8 But he knew their reasonings, and he said to the man having a dried up hand, <b>Arise and stand; <i>you</i> in the middle.</b> Now rising* up, he stood <i>there</i>. 
6:9 And Jesus said to them, <b>I ask you* something, Is it legal on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil? To save a life or to destroy it?</b> 
6:10 And having looked around on them all, he said to him, <b>Stretch out your hand.</b> Now he did, and his hand was restored like the other. 
6:11 But they were filled with madness, and were talking to one another <i>as to</i> what they might do to Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 3:13-19a &amp; Lk 6:12-16 Near Capernaum.}</p>
<p>6:12 Now it happened in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray, and he was persisting through the night in prayer to God. 
6:13 And when it became day, he summons his disciples, and he chose from them twelve, whom he also named apostles: 
6:14 Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John and Philip and Bartholomew, 
6:15 and Matthew and Thomas, and James <i>the son</i> of Alphaeus and Simon who was called the Zealot, 
6:16 and Judas <i>the son</i> {Or: brother of; See Jude.} of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a betrayer.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 
5:1 &amp; Lk 6:17-20. Sermon on the mountain.}</p>
<p>6:17 And he came down with them and stood upon the plain, and <i>with</i> a crowd of his disciples and a large multitude of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; 
6:18 and those who were troubled by unclean spirits were being healed. 
6:19 And all the crowd was seeking to touch him, because power was coming out from him and was healing <i>them</i> all.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 5:2-12 &amp; Lk 6:20-26.}</p>
<p>6:20 And he lifted up his eyes toward his disciples and said: <b>You* <i>the</i> poor <i>are</i> fortunate, because the kingdom of God is yours*.</b> 
6:21 <b>You* who hunger now <i>are</i> fortunate, because you* will be fed. You* who are weeping now <i>are</i> fortunate, because you* will laugh.</b> 
6:22 <b>You* are fortunate, whenever men hate you* and whenever they separate* you* <i>from themselves,</i> and may reproach you* and may cast out your* name like evil, because of the Son of Man.</b> 
6:23 <b>Rejoice in that day and jump <i>for joy,</i> for* behold your* reward is much in heaven; for* their fathers were doing to the prophets according to the same things.</b></p>
<p>6:24 <b>However, woe to you* who are rich, because you* are having your* consolation!</b> 
6:25 <b>Woe to you* who have been filled, because you* will hunger! Woe to you* who laugh now, because you* will mourn and weep!</b> 
6:26 <b>Woe <i>to you</i>* whenever men speak well of you*, for* their fathers were doing to the false prophets according to the same things!</b></p>
<p>{Mt 5:17-48 &amp; Lk 6:27-36.}</p>
<p>6:27 <b>But I am saying to you* who hear, Love* your* enemies, do good to those who hate you*,</b> 
6:28 <b>speak well of those who curse you*, pray on behalf of those who are railing at you*.</b> 
6:29 <b>Hold near to him who beats you upon the <i>one</i> jaw, the other also, and from him who takes away your garment, do not forbid <i>him</i> your tunic also.</b> 
6:30 <b>Give to everyone who asks you, and from him who takes away what is yours, do not ask for <i>it</i> back.</b></p>
<p>{Mt 
7:12 &amp; Lk 6:31.}</p>
<p>6:31 <b>And just-as you* wish that* men may do to you*, you* also, do likewise to them.</b> 
6:32 <b>And if you* love* those who love* you*, what gratitude do you* have? For* even sinners love* those who love* them.</b> 
6:33 <b>And if you* do good to those who are doing good to you*, what gratitude do you* have? For* even sinners are doing the same.</b> 
6:34 <b>And if you* lend to those of whom you* are hoping to receive, what gratitude do you* have? For* even sinners are lending to sinners, that* they might receive equally.</b> 
6:35 <b>However, love* your* enemies and do kind <i>things for them</i> and lend, hoping for nothing again. And your* reward will be much, and you* will be sons of the Highest, because he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.</b> 
6:36 <b>Therefore, become compassionate, just-as your* Father is also compassionate.</b></p>
<p>{Mt 7:1-6 &amp; Lk 6:37-42.}</p>
<p>6:37 <b>And do not judge and you* may never* be judged; do not sentence <i>others</i> and you* may never* be sentenced; release and you* will be released.</b> 
6:38 <b>Give and it will be given to you*, good measure, having been packed-down and shaken <i>together</i> and pouring over, they will give into your* bosom. For* with the same measure you* measure, it will be measured to you* again.</b></p>
<br>
<p>6:39 Now he also spoke a parable to them: <b>Is a blind <i>person</i> able to guide the blind? Will they not both fall into a ditch?</b> 
6:40 <b>The disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone having been matured</b> {i.e. completed the training}<b>, will be like his teacher.</b> 
6:41 <b>But why do you see the speck which is in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the beam which is in your own eye?</b> 
6:42 <b>Or how are you able to say to your brother, Brother, Allow <i>me, that</i> I may cast out the speck which is in your eye, when* you yourself do not see the beam which is in your own eye? You hypocrite, cast out the beam first out of your own eye, and then you will see precisely to cast out the speck which is in your brother’s eye.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 7:13-23 &amp; Lk 6:43-45.}</p>
<p>6:43 <b>For* there is not a good tree producing rotten fruit; nor <i>is there</i> a rotten tree producing good fruit.</b> 
6:44 <b>For* each tree is known from its own fruit. For* men do not collect figs from thorns, nor do they pick a grape-cluster from a bush.</b> 
6:45 <b>The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth what is evil; for* his mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 7:24-29 &amp; Lk 6:46-49.}</p>
<p>6:46 <b>Now why are you* calling me, Lord, Lord and <i>yet</i> do not practice the things which I say?</b> 
6:47 <b>Everyone who comes to me and hears my words, and is doing them, I will show you* to whom he is similar.</b> 
6:48 <b>He is similar to a man building a house, who dug and <i>then</i> deepened and placed <i>its</i> foundation upon the rock, and when* a deluge happened, the river bursts against that house and was not strong-enough to shake it; for* it had been founded upon the rock.</b> 
6:49  <b>But he who heard and did not, is similar to a man who built a house upon the earth without a foundation; which the river bursts against, and immediately it fell, and the breakup of that house became great.</b></p>
<h3>Luke 7</h3>
<p>{Mt 8:1, 8:5-13 &amp; Lk 7:1-10 Capernaum.}</p>
<p>7:1 Now since he had fulfilled all his declarations in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum. 
7:2 Now a certain centurion’s bondservant, who was precious to him, being ill, and was about to die*. 
7:3 Now having heard <i>things</i> concerning Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews; requesting of him, *that he <i>might</i> come and might save his bondservant. 
7:4 Now when* they came to Jesus, they were pleading with him diligently, saying, He is worthy *that you will provide this for him; 
7:5 for* he loves* our nation and he built us our synagogue.</p>
<p>7:6 Now Jesus was traveling together with them. Now already, when* he was not far distant from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, do not be bothered; for* I am not sufficient that* you should enter under my roof. 
7:7 Hence, not even I myself deemed it worthy to come to you, but say <i>it</i> with a word, and my young-servant will be healed. 
7:8 For* I am also a man appointed under authority, having soldiers under myself, and I say to this one, Go-onward and he goes-onward, and to another, Come and he comes, and to my bondservant, Do this and he does it.</p>
<p>7:9 Now having heard these things, Jesus marveled at him and turned and said to the crowd that followed him,  <b>I say to you*, I have not found so-great a faith, not even in Israel.</b> 
7:10 And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the sick bondservant healthy.</p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 7:11-17 At Nain in Galilee; no parallel.}</p>
<p>7:11 And it happened on the <i>next day</i>, that he was traveling to a city called Nain, and his considerable <i>number of</i> disciples and a large crowd was traveling together with him. 
7:12 Now as he drew near to the gate of the city, behold also, <i>one</i> who had died, was being entombed, the only begotten son of his mother and she was a widow and a considerable crowd from the city were together with her. 
7:13 And the Lord, having seen her, had compassion upon her and said to her, <b>Do not weep.</b> 
7:14 And he came near and touched the funeral bier, and those bearing <i>it</i> stopped. Now he said, <b>Young-man, I say to you, Arise.</b></p>
<p>7:15 And he who was dead sat up and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother. 
7:16 Now fear took all and they were glorifying God, saying, A great prophet has arisen among us, and that God has visited his people. 
7:17 And this word went forth concerning him in the whole <i>region</i> of Judea, and in all the region around.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 11:2-30 &amp; Lk 7:18-35 Galilee.}</p>
<p>7:18 And the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things. 
7:19 And John, calling to him a certain two of his disciples, sent <i>them</i> to Jesus, saying, Are you he who is coming or are we expecting another?</p>
<p>7:20 Now when* the men came to him, they said, John the Immerser* has sent us to you, saying, Are you he who is coming or are we expecting another? 
7:21 He healed many of diseases and disorders and evil spirits in the same hour, and he granted <i>to</i> many <i>of the</i> blind to see.</p>
<p>7:22 And Jesus answered and said to them, <b>When* you* travel <i>back</i>, report to John the things which you* have seen and heard; that the blind recover their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and <i>the</i> mute hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the good-news proclaimed to them.</b> 
7:23 <b>And he, whoever is not offended in me, is fortunate.</b></p>
<br>
<p>7:24 Now when* the messengers of John went away, he began to say to the crowds concerning John, <b>What have you* come out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</b> 
7:25 <b>But what have you* come out to see? A man having been dressed-up in soft garments? Behold, those who are in glorious garments and being* in splendor, are in <i>the</i> royal <i>courts</i>.</b> 
7:26 <b>But what have you* come out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you*, And more-than a prophet.</b> 
7:27 <b>This is he concerning whom it has been written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.</b> {Mal. 3:1} 
7:28 <b>For* I say to you*, Among those born of women there is no prophet greater <i>than</i> John the Immerser*; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater <i>than</i> he.</b> 
7:29 And all the people and the tax collectors, having heard <i>this</i>, justified God, having been immersed* in the immersion* of John. 
7:30 But the Pharisees and the professors of the law rejected the counsel of God *for themselves, having not been immersed* by him. 
7:31 <b>Then* to what shall be similar to the men of this generation, and to what are they similar?</b> 
7:32 <b>They are similar to children who are sitting in the marketplace and <i>are</i> shouting to one another and saying, We piped to you* and you* did not dance; we mourned for you* and you* did not weep.</b> 
7:33 <b>For* John the Immerser* has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you* say, He has a demon.</b> 
7:34 <b>The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you* say, Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!</b> 
7:35 <b>And wisdom was justified from all her children.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 7:36-50 Galilee; no parallel.}</p>
<br>
<p>7:36 Now someone from the Pharisees asked him, that* he might eat with him. And having entered into the Pharisee’s house, he reclined <i>at a meal.</i> 
7:37 And behold, a woman who was in the city, who was a sinner, when* she recognized that he is reclining <i>at a meal</i> in the Pharisee’s house, she fetched an alabaster flask of perfume, 
7:38 and standing by his feet behind <i>him</i>, weeping, she began to rain on his feet with her tears and was wiping them with the hairs of her head and was kissing his feet, and was anointing them with the perfume. 
7:39 Now when* the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he spoke in himself, saying, This one, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, that she is a sinner.</p>
<p>7:40 And Jesus answered and said to him, <b>Simon, I have something to say to you.</b></p>
<p>But he says, Teacher, say <i>it</i>.</p>
<p>7:41 <b>There was two debtors to a lender: a certain one was owing five hundred denarii and <i>the</i> other fifty.</b> 
7:42  <b>But when* they did not have <i>anything</i> to repay <i>him with</i>, he forgave* them both. Therefore, tell me which of them will love* him most?</b></p>
<p>7:43 But Simon answered and said, I am taking <i>it as</i>, he to whom he forgave* the most.</p>
<p>But he said to him, <b>You have judged correctly.</b></p>
<p>7:44 And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, <b>Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, you gave me no water for my feet, but she has rained on my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</b> 
7:45 <b>You gave me no kiss, but, from the <i>time</i> I came in she has continually kissed my feet.</b> 
7:46 <b>You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume.</b> 
7:47 <b>Because of which, I say to you, Her sins, which are many, have been forgiven, because she loved* much, but to whom few is forgiven, <i>the same</i> loves* few.</b> 
7:48 Now he said to her, <b>Your sins have been forgiven.</b></p>
<p>7:49 And those who reclined <i>at the meal</i> together with him began to speak with* themselves, Who is this, who forgives even sins?</p>
<p>7:50 But he said to the woman, <b>Your faith has cured you. Travel in peace.</b></p>
<h3>Luke 8</h3>
<p>{Lk 8:1-3 Journeying in Galilee; no parallel.}</p>
<p>8:1 And it happened afterwards also, <i>that</i> he was traveling through every city and village, preaching and proclaiming the good-news of the kingdom of God and the twelve <i>were</i> together with him, 
8:2 and some women who were healed of evil spirits and sicknesses: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, 
8:3 and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s commissioner, and Susanna, and many others who were serving them from their possessions.</p>
<p>{Mk 4:1-25 &amp; Mt 13:1-23 &amp; Lk 8:4-18 Sea of Galilee.}</p>
<p>8:4 Now a large crowd <i>was</i> coming together and he spoke through a parable <i>to</i> those who were traveling to him <i>from</i> every city. 
8:5 <b>The sower went forth to sow his seed, and while* he sowing, some fell by the road, and it was trampled down and the birds of the heaven devoured it.</b> 
8:6 <b>And other fell upon the rock, and when* it sprang up, it dried up, because it had no moisture.</b> 
8:7 <b>And other fell in <i>the</i> midst of the thorns, and the thorns sprang up together with it and choked it.</b> 
8:8 <b>And other fell into the good soil, and sprang up and produced fruit a hundred-times <i>over</i>.</b> <i>While</i> saying these things, he was shouting, <b>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</b></p>
<p>8:9 But his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be <i>about</i>?</p>
<p>8:10 But he said, <b>It has been given to you* to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but <i>it is</i> in parables to the rest; that* seeing, they may not see; and hearing, they may not understand.</b> {Isa 6:9} 
8:11 <b>Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God.</b> 
8:12 <b>But those by the road are those who hear; thereafter, the Devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, that* they may not believe and be saved.</b> 
8:13 <b>But those upon the rock <i>are</i> those who, whenever they hear, accept the word with joy, and these have no root, who for a <i>short</i> time believe, and in time of temptation, withdraw.</b> 
8:14 <b>But what fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and while* they are going-onward <i>with life</i>, they are choked by anxieties and riches and sensual-delights of <i>this</i> life, and they are not bringing <i>themselves</i> to maturity.</b> 
8:15 <b>But that <i>seed</i> in the good soil, these are such as in a good and beautiful heart, having heard the word, hold-onto it and are bearing-fruit with* endurance.</b></p>
<br>
<p>8:16 <b>Now no one, having lit a lamp, hides it in a vessel or places it underneath a bed, but places it upon a lamp-stand, that* those who travel in may see the light.</b> 
8:17 <b>For* there is not <i>anything</i> hid, that will not become apparent; nor <i>anything</i> secret, that will not be known and may come into apparent <i>view</i>.</b> 
8:18  <b>Therefore beware, how you* hear; for* whoever has, <i>more</i> will be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he seems to have will be taken away from him.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 3:31-35 &amp; Mt 12:46-50 &amp; Lk 8:19-21.}</p>
<p>8:19 Now there came to him his mother and brethren, and they were not able to get-close to him because of the crowd. 
8:20 And it was reported to him, saying, Your mother and your brethren are standing outside, wishing to see you.</p>
<p>8:21 But he answered and said to them, <b>My mother and my brethren are those who hear the word of God and <i>are</i> doing it.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 4:35-41 &amp; Mt:8:18-27 &amp; Lk 8:22-25 Sea of Galilee.}</p>
<p>8:22 Now it happened on one of those days, that he stepped onto a ship, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, <b>We should go over to the <i>area</i> beyond-that of the lake.</b> And they set-sail. 
8:23 But while* they are sailing, he slept and a gale of wind came down toward the lake, and they were filling <i>with water</i>, and were in peril.</p>
<p>8:24 Now having come to him, they aroused him, saying, Master*, Master*! We are perishing. But having arisen, he rebuked the wind and the wave of the water, and they ceased, and it became calm.</p>
<p>8:25 Now he said to them, <b>Where is your* faith?</b></p>
<p>But being afraid, they marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water and they are obeying* him?</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 5:1-21 &amp; Mt 8:28-34 &amp; Lk 8:26-40 Gergesa.}</p>
<p>8:26 And they sailed down to the region of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee. 
8:27 Now when* Jesus had gone forth upon the land, a certain man out of the city met him, who was held by demons, and he had not clothed himself with a garment in a considerable time and was not abiding in <i>any</i> house, but <i>lived</i> in the tombs. 
8:28 Now when* he saw Jesus, and having cried out, he fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What <i>is this thing</i> with me and with you, Jesus, Son of the Highest God? I beseech of you. Do not torment me. 
8:29 For* he commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For* many times it had seized him, and he was being guarded and bound with chains and shackles, and ripping the bonds, he was being driven by the demon into the wilderness.</p>
<p>8:30 Now Jesus asked him, saying, <b>What is your name?</b></p>
<p>Now he said, Legion. (Because many demons had entered into him.) 
8:31 And he was pleading with him that* he might not command them to go away into the abyss. 
8:32 Now a considerable herd of swine was there, feeding at the mountain. And he was pleading with him that* he might permit them to enter into those <i>swine</i>. And he permitted them. 
8:33 Now the demons having gone out from the man, entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and were choking <i>to death</i>. 
8:34 Now when* those who are feeding them saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the rural-area. 
8:35 Now they went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man, from whom the demons had gone out, sitting, having on garments and sensible, beside the feet of Jesus, and they were afraid. 
8:36 But those who saw it reported to them also, how he who was demon-possessed was cured. 
8:37 And all the multitude of the region around the Gadarenes asked him to go away from them, because they were being held by great fear, and he stepped into the ship and returned. 
8:38 Now the man from whom the demons had gone out of, was beseeching to be together with him.</p>
<p>But Jesus dismissed him, saying, 
8:39 <b>Return to your house, and describe how-much God has done for you.</b> And he went away, preaching down through the whole city how much Jesus had done to him.</p>
<br>
<p>8:40 Now it happened while* Jesus was returning, the crowd accepted him; for* they were all expecting him.</p>
<p>{Mk 5:22-43 &amp; Mt 9:18-26 &amp; Lk 8:41-56 Capernaum.}</p>
<p>8:41 And behold, a man whose name <i>was</i> Jairus came, and he possessed <i>the office of</i> ruler of the synagogue, and he fell beside Jesus’ feet and was pleading with him to come into his house; 
8:42 because there was to him an only begotten daughter, approximately twelve years <i>old</i>, and she was dying. But while* he was going, the crowds were <i>too close</i>, choking him.</p>
<br>
<p>8:43 And a woman, having a flowing of blood twelve years, who had consumed her whole livelihood upon physicians, was not strong-enough to be healed by anyone. 
8:44 She came behind him and touched the hem of his garment, and instantly, the flowing of her blood stopped. 
8:45 And Jesus said, <b>Who touched my <i>garment</i>?</b></p>
<p>But when* all denied, Peter and those with him said, Master*, the crowds are crowding <i>against</i> you, and are pressing against <i>you</i> and you say, Who touched my <i>garment</i>?</p>
<p>8:46 But Jesus said, <b>Someone touched me; for* I knew <i>that</i> power had gone forth from me.</b></p>
<p>8:47 Now when* the woman saw that she was not eluding <i>him</i>, she came trembling, and having fallen down before him, reported to him in the sight of all the people, because of what cause she touched him and how she was healed instantly.</p>
<p>8:48 Now he said to her, <b>Have courage daughter, your faith has cured you; travel in peace.</b></p>
<br>
<p>8:49 <i>While</i> still speaking, someone from the ruler of the synagogue’s <i>house</i> comes, saying, Your daughter has died; do not bother the Teacher.</p>
<p>8:50 But Jesus hearing it, answered him, saying, <b>Do not fear. Only believe and she will be cured.</b> 
8:51 Now having entered into the house, he allowed no one to enter <i>it</i>, except Peter and John and James, and the father and the mother of the child. 
8:52 Now all were weeping and grieving her. But he said, <b>Do not weep; she is not dead, but is sleeping.</b> 
8:53 And they were laughing at him, knowing that she was dead. 
8:54 But he, having cast everyone outside and taking-hold of her hand, shouted, saying, <b>Child, arise.</b> 
8:55 And her spirit returned, and she rose* up instantly, and he commanded that <i>something</i> be given to her to eat. 
8:56 Now her parents were astonished, but he commanded them to tell no one what had happened.</p>

<h3>Luke 9</h3>
<p>{Mk 6:6b-13 &amp; Mt 9:35-
10:42 &amp; Lk 9:1-6 Third circuit of Galilee.}</p>
<p>9:1 Now he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons and to heal diseases. 
9:2 And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. 
9:3 And he said to them, <b>Take nothing *for your* journey, neither staffs, nor knapsack, nor bread, nor silver; nor to have two tunics apiece.</b> 
9:4 <b>And into whatever house you* enter, remain there and <i>then</i> go forth from there.</b> 
9:5 <b>And as many as may not accept you*, when* you* go forth from that city, shake-off even the dust from your* feet *for a testimony against them.</b> 
9:6 Now going out, they were going throughout the villages, proclaiming the good-news and healing everywhere.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 6:14-29 &amp; Mt 14:1-12 &amp; Lk 9:7-9.}</p>
<p>9:7 Now Herod the Tetrarch heard of all the things happening by him, and was perplexed, because it was said by some, that John has been raised from the dead; 
9:8 and by some, that Elijah had appeared, and by others, that one of the ancient prophets had risen*. 
9:9 And Herod said, I beheaded John, but who is this, concerning whom I am hearing such things? Now he was seeking to see him.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 6:30-32 &amp; Mt 
14:13 &amp; Lk 
9:10 &amp; Jn 
6:1 East shore of Galilee.}</p>
<p>9:10 And the apostles, having returned, described to him how-much they had done. Now he took them and departed privately into a desolate place of a city called Bethsaida.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 6:33-44 &amp; Mt 14:14-21 &amp; Lk 9:11-17 &amp; Jn 6:2-14.}</p>
<p>9:11 But the crowds, having known it, followed him, and having accepted them, he was speaking to them concerning the kingdom of God, and he was healing those who had need of healing. 
9:12 Now the day began to be far-spent, and the twelve came and said to him, Dismiss the crowd, that* they <i>may</i> go into the villages and the surrounding rural-area, and may board and may find nutrition, because we are here in a wilderness place.</p>
<p>9:13 But he said to them, <b>You*, give them <i>something</i> to eat.</b></p>
<p>But they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish; lest we indeed <i>may</i> travel and may buy food *for all of these people. 
9:14 For* they were approximately five thousand men.</p>
<p>Now he said to his disciples, <b>Have them recline in parties, <i>approximately</i> fifty apiece.</b> 
9:15 And they did so and made* them all recline. 
9:16 Now he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave-thanks and broke them, and was giving <i>them</i> to the disciples to place beside the crowd. 
9:17 And they ate and all were fed, and twelve baskets of broken pieces were lifted up, what was leftover from them <i>eating</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 8:27-30 &amp; Mt 16:13-20 &amp; Lk 9:18-21 Caesarea Philippi.}</p>
<p>9:18 And it happened, while he was praying alone, the disciples were together with him and he asked them, saying, <b>Who do the crowds say that I am?</b></p>
<p>9:19 But they answered and said, John the Immerser*, but others <i>say</i>, Elijah, and others, that someone from the ancient prophets has risen*.</p>
<p>9:20 But he said to them, <b>But who do you* say that I am?</b></p>
<p>But Peter answered and said, The Christ of God.</p>
<p>{Mk 8:31-
9:1 &amp; Mt 16:21-28 &amp; Lk 9:22-27 Caesarea Philippi.}</p>
<p>9:21 But he rebuked and commanded them to tell this to no one, 
9:22 saying, <b>It is essential <i>for</i> the Son of Man to suffer many things, and to be rejected* by the elders and high-priests and scribes, and be killed and rise in the third day.</b></p>
<br>
<p>9:23 Now he said to all, <b>If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, and lift up his cross and follow me.</b> 
9:24 <b>For* whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life because of me, this one will save it.</b> 
9:25 <b>For* what is a man profited, having gained the whole world, but has lost or forfeited himself?</b> 
9:26 <b>For* whoever is ashamed of me, and of my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him whenever he comes in his own glory, and <i>the glory</i> of the Father and of the holy messengers.</b> 
9:27 <b>But I tell you* truly, There are some of those who are standing here, who may never* taste of death, until they should see the kingdom of God.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 9:2-13 &amp; Mt 17:1-13 &amp; Lk 9:28-36 Caesarea Philippi.}</p>
<p>9:28 Now it happened approximately eight days after these words, that he took with <i>him</i> Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray. 
9:29 And while* he was praying, the form of his face was a different <i>form</i>, and his garments <i>became</i> white <i>and</i> dazzling. 
9:30 And behold, two men were speaking together with him here, who were Moses and Elijah; 
9:31 who appeared in glory, and were telling of his exodus which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem. 
9:32 Now Peter and those who were together with him were heavy with sleep, but <i>then</i> thoroughly awaken, saw his glory and the two men standing together with him.</p>
<p>9:33 And it happened, while* they were separating from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master*, it is good for us to be here, and we should make* three tabernacles: one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah; (not knowing <i>exactly</i> what he said).</p>
<p>9:34 Now <i>while</i> saying these things, there became a cloud and overshadowed them, and they feared while* those <i>men</i> were entering into the cloud. 
9:35 And a voice came* out of the cloud, saying, <b>This is my beloved Son; hear him.</b> 
9:36 And while* the voice happened, Jesus was found alone. And they were silent and reported to no one in those days, any of the things which they had seen.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 9:14-29 &amp; Mt 17:14-21 &amp; Lk 9:37-43 Region of Caesarea Philippi.}</p>
<p>9:37 Now it happened, on the next <i>day</i>, having come down from the mountain, a large crowd met him. 
9:38 And behold, a man from the crowd cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech of you to look upon my son, because he is my only begotten child. 
9:39 And behold, a spirit takes him and he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him with foaming <i>from the mouth</i>, and it departs from him with difficulty, bruising him. 
9:40 And I besought of your disciples that* they might cast it out, and they were not able.</p>
<p>9:41 And, Jesus answered and said, <b>O unbelieving and perverse generation, until when will I be with you* and tolerate you*? Bring* your son here.</b> 
9:42 But <i>while</i> coming near, the demon ripped at him and convulsed <i>him</i>. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</p>
<p>{Mk 9:30-32 &amp; Mt 17:22-23 &amp; Lk 9:43-45 Return to Galilee.}</p>
<p>9:43 Now they were all being astounded at the majesty of God.</p>
<p>But <i>while all were</i> marveling upon all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples, 
9:44 <b>Place these words into your* ears; for* the Son of Man is about to be given up into the hands of men.</b> 
9:45 But they were not considering this declaration, and it was hiding from them, that* they might not comprehend it, and they were afraid to ask him concerning this declaration.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 9:33-50 &amp; Mt 18:1-14 &amp; Lk 9:46-50 Sept. 29 AD.}</p>
<p>9:46 Now there entered a reasoning among them, whoever of them was the greater. 
9:47 But when* Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child and stood him beside himself, 
9:48 and said to them, <b>Whoever accepts this little child in my name accepts me, and whoever accepts me, accepts him who sent me; for* he who is* least among you* all, this one will be great.</b></p>
<br>
<p>9:49 But John answered and said, Master*, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we did forbid him, because he is not following after us. 
9:50 But Jesus said to him, <b>Do not forbid <i>him</i>; for* he who is not against us, is <i>fighting</i> on our behalf.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 9:51-56 &amp; Jn 7:10; Samaria, Sept: 29 AD.}</p>
<p>9:51 Now it happened, when* the days were being fulfilled of his taking up, he established his face to travel to Jerusalem, 
9:52 and sent messengers before his face, and they traveled and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so-then to prepare for him. 
9:53 But they did not accept him, because his face was <i>established to be</i> traveling to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>9:54 Now when* his disciples James and John saw <i>this</i>, they said, Lord, do you will <i>that</i> we should tell <i>the</i> fire to come down from heaven and consume them as Elisha also did?</p>
<p>9:55 But he turned and rebuked them, and said, <b>You* do not know of what spirit you* are.</b> 
9:56 <b>For* the Son of man did not come to destroy the lives of men, but to save <i>them</i>.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 9:56b-62; no parallel. Similar: Mt 8:20-22}</p>
<p>And they traveled to a different village. 
9:57 Now it happened <i>while</i> traveling on the road, a certain man said to him, I will follow you wherever you go, Lord.</p>
<p>9:58 And Jesus said to him, <b>The foxes have burrows and the birds of the heaven <i>have</i> nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere <i>that</i> he may bow his head.</b></p>
<p>9:59 But he said to a different <i>one</i>, <b>Follow me.</b></p>
<p>But he said, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father<b>.</b></p>
<p>9:60 But Jesus said to him, <b>Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and thoroughly proclaim the kingdom of God.</b></p>
<p>9:61 But a different <i>one</i> also said, I will follow you, Lord, but permit me first to bid farewell to those <i>who are</i> in my house.</p>
<p>9:62 But Jesus said to him, <b>No one, having put his hand upon the plow and looking behind, is fit *for the kingdom of God.</b></p>
<h3>Luke 10</h3>
<p>{Lk 10:1-24; Probably Judea, Oct: 29 AD; no parallel.}</p>
<p>10:1 Now after these things, the Lord also delegated seventy others, and sent them up two <i>by two</i> into every city and place before his face, where he himself was about to go. 
10:2 Therefore he said to them, <b>The harvest is indeed large, but the workers are few, therefore beseech of the Lord of the harvest, *that he should put out workers into his harvest.</b> 
10:3 <b>Go, behold, I am sending you* forth like lambs in the midst of wolves.</b> 
10:4 <b>Bear no money-bag, no knapsack, no shoes, and greet no one on the road.</b> 
10:5 <b>Now into whatever house you* enter, say first, Peace <i>be</i> to this house.</b> 
10:6 <b>And if a son of peace is there, your* peace will rest upon it, otherwise it will revisit you*.</b> 
10:7 <b>Now abide in that same house, eating and drinking such things as they give; for* the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not proceed from house to house.</b></p>
<p>10:8 <b>And into whatever city you* enter, and <i>if</i> they accept you*, eat such things as are placed beside you*;</b> 
10:9 <b>and heal the sick who are in it and say to them, The kingdom of God has drawn near to you*.</b> 
10:10 <b>But into whatever city you* enter, and <i>if</i> they do not accept you*, go out into its streets and say,</b> 
10:11 <b>Even the dust from your* city, that was stuck to our feet, we wipe off at you*. However, know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn near to you*.</b> 
10:12 <b>I say to you*, It will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.</b></p>
<p>10:13 <b>Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles had happened in Tyre and Sidon, which have happened in you*, they would have repented long-ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</b> 
10:14 <b>However it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you*.</b> 
10:15 <b>And you, Capernaum, who has been exalted to heaven. You will step down to Hades.</b> 
10:16 <b>He who hears you*, hears me; and he who is rejecting you*, rejects me; and he who rejects me, rejects him who sent me</b>.</p>
<br>
<p>10:17 Now the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name.</p>
<p>10:18 But he said to them, <b>I was viewing the Adversary falling like lightning from heaven.</b> 
10:19  <b>Behold, I am giving you* authority to trample down serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and you* may never* be hurt by anything.</b> 
10:20 <b>However, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you*, but rejoice that your* names are written in the heavens.</b></p>
<br>
<p>10:21 Jesus was glad in the spirit in that same hour, and said, <b>I profess you, O Father, Lord of the heaven and the earth, because you hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to infants. Yes Father, because thus it became a delight before you.</b></p>
<p>10:22 And having turned to the disciples, he said, <b>All things have been given to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son and he to whomever the Son wills to reveal <i>him</i>.</b></p>
<p>10:23 And having turned to the disciples, he said privately, <b>The eyes which see what you* see are fortunate.</b> 
10:24 <b>For* I say to you*, that many prophets and kings wished to see the things which you* are seeing and did not see them, and to hear the things which you* are hearing and did not hear them.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 10:25-37; Probably Judea; no parallel.}</p>
<p>10:25 And behold, a certain professor of the law stood up, testing him and saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit everlasting life?</p>
<p>10:26 But he said to him, <b>What has been written in the law? How do you read <i>it</i>?</b></p>
<p>10:27 But he answered and said, ‘You will love* the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole strength and from your whole mind, and your neighbor like yourself.’ {Deu. 
6:5 &amp; Lev. 19:18}</p>
<p>10:28 But he said to him, <b>You have answered correctly. Do this and you will live.</b></p>
<p>10:29 But he, wishing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?</p>
<p>10:30 But Jesus, having taken <i>it in</i>, said, <b>A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and laid wounds <i>on him</i>. They went away, leaving <i>him,</i> being half dead.</b> 
10:31 <b>But by coincidence, a certain priest was going down on that road, and when* he saw him, he evaded <i>him</i>.</b> 
10:32 <b>Now likewise, a Levite also happened <i>to be</i> in the place, when* he came and saw him, he evaded <i>him too</i>.</b> 
10:33 <b>But a certain traveling Samaritan came to him, and having seen him, had compassion.</b> 
10:34 <b>And having come <i>near</i> to him, he bound up his trauma, pouring on <i>them</i> oil and wine, and having mounted him upon his own animal, led him to an inn and cared for him.</b> 
10:35 <b>And upon the next-day, going out, he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, Care for him, and if you spend anything over that, I will repay you when* I come back again.</b> 
10:36 <b>Therefore, which <i>one</i> of these three seems to have become a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?</b></p>
<p>10:37 Now he said, He who did <i>an act of</i> mercy with him.</p>
<p>Therefore, Jesus said to him, <b>Go-onward, and you, do likewise!</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 10:38-42; Bethany, near Jerusalem; no parallel.}</p>
<p>10:38 But it happened while* they were also traveling, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman, Martha by name, accepted him into her house. 
10:39 And she was a sister <i>to one</i> called Mary, who also sat beside the feet of Jesus and was hearing his word. 
10:40 But Martha was being distracted concerning much, serving <i>them</i>, and she standing by <i>him</i>, said, Lord, do you not care that my sister left me to serve alone? Therefore speak to her that* she may jointly help me.</p>
<p>10:41 But Jesus answered and said to her, <b>Martha, Martha, you are anxious and disturbed concerning many things,</b> 
10:42 <b>but there is need of one thing, and Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.</b></p>
<h3>Luke 11</h3>
<p>{Lk 11:1-13:9; Probably Judea; no parallel. This is similar teaching to different crowd.}</p>
<p>{Similar: Mt 6:9-13; Lk 11:1-5}</p>
<p>11:1 And it happened, while* he was praying in a certain place, that as he ceased, someone from his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, just-as John also taught his disciples.</p>
<p>11:2 Now he said to them, <b>Whenever you* pray, say, Our Father, who is in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will happen as in heaven, also upon the earth.</b> 
11:3 <b>Give our</b> {F} <b>needful daily bread to us.</b> 
11:4 <b>And forgive us our sins; for* we ourselves also forgive everyone who is obligated to us. And do not bring us into temptation, but rescue us from the evil <i>one</i>.</b></p>
<br>
<p>11:5 And he said to them, <b>Which out of you* will have a friend, and will travel to him <i>at</i> midnight and may say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves,</b> 
11:6 <b>since a friend has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing <i>as to</i> what I will place beside him.</b> 
11:7 <b>And he will answer <i>from</i> inside and should say, Do not be harassing me. The door has already been locked and my children are in the bunk with me. I am not able to give to you <i>bread, even if</i> I rise* up.</b> 
11:8 <b>I say to you*, Even if he will not rise* and give to him because he is his friend, yet because of his irreverence, he will arise and give him as many as he needs.</b></p>
<p>{Similar: Mt 7:7-11, Lk 11:9-13}</p>
<p>11:9 <b>And I say to you*, Ask and it will be given <i>to</i> you*; seek and you* will find; knock and it will be opened to you*.</b> 
11:10 <b>For* everyone who asks, receives; and he who is seeking, finds; and to him who knocks, it will be opened.</b> 
11:11 <b>Now which father of you* will the son ask for a loaf; he will not give him a stone, will he? Or also a fish, he will not give him a serpent instead of a fish, will he?</b> 
11:12 <b>Or if he asks for an egg, he will not give him a scorpion, will he?</b> 
11:13 <b>Therefore if you*, possessing evil, know how to give good presents to your* children, how much more will <i>your</i>* Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Similar: Mt 12:22-37, Mk 3:22-26, Lk 11:14-23}</p>
<p>11:14 Now he was casting out a demon and it was mute. And it happened, when* the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke, and the crowds marveled. 
11:15 But some out of them said, He is casting out demons by Beelzebub the ruler of the demons. 
11:16 But others, testing <i>him</i>, were seeking a sign from heaven from him.</p>
<p>11:17 But he, knowing their minds, said to them, <b>Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and a house <i>divided</i> against a house falls.</b> 
11:18 <b>But if the Adversary is also divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? Because you* say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.</b> 
11:19 <b>But if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your* sons cast them out? Because of this, they will be your* judges.</b> 
11:20 <b>But if I cast out demons by the finger of God; consequently*, the kingdom of God has arrived-unexpectedly upon you*.</b></p>
<p>11:21 <b>Whenever the fully armed strong <i>man</i> is guarding his own courtyard, his possessions are in peace.</b> 
11:22 <b>But whenever the <i>one</i> mightier <i>than</i> him, having come upon <i>him</i> and <i>then</i>, overcomes him, he takes away his full-armor upon which he had confidence in, and distributes his haul.</b> 
11:23 <b>He who is not with me is against me, and he who is not gathering with me, scatters.</b></p>
<p>{Similar: Mt 12:43-45, Lk 11:14-28}</p>
<p>11:24 <b>The unclean spirit, whenever it has come out of the man, goes through waterless places, seeking rest, and finding none, it says, I will turn back to my house from where I came out.</b> 
11:25 <b>And having come <i>back</i>, he finds <i>that</i> it has been swept and adorned.</b> 
11:26 <b>Then it travels and takes <i>with it</i> seven other spirits more evil <i>than</i> itself, and they come and dwell there and the last <i>state</i> of that man becomes worse <i>than</i> the first.</b></p>
<br>
<p>11:27 Now it happened, while* he said these things, a certain woman out of the crowd lifted up her voice and said to him, The womb bearing you, and the breasts which you nursed, are fortunate.</p>
<p>11:28 But he said, <b>But-rather, those who hear the word of God and are observing <i>it</i>, are fortunate.</b></p>
<br>

<p>11:29 Now when* the crowds accumulated, he began to say, <b>This generation is an evil <i>generation</i>. It is seeking after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.</b> 
11:30 <b>For* just-as Jonah the prophet became a sign to the Ninevites, so the Son of Man will also be to this generation.</b> 
11:31 <b>The queen of the south will have arisen up with the men of this generation in the judgment, and will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, more-than Solomon is here.</b> 
11:32 <b>The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, because they repented from the preaching of Jonah, and behold, more-than Jonah is here.</b></p>

<p>11:33 <b>No one, having lit a lamp, places it in a cellar, nor under the peck container, but upon the lamp-stand, that* those who travel in may see the radiance <i>of it</i>.</b> 
11:34 <b>The lamp of the body is the eye; therefore, whenever your eye is clear, your whole body is also radiant, but whenever it is evil, your body is also dark.</b>  
11:35 <b>Therefore, note that the light which is in you is not darkness.</b> 
11:36 <b>Therefore, if your whole body is radiant, not having any part dark, it will be entirely radiant, as whenever the lamp illuminates you with <i>its</i> rays.</b></p>

<p>11:37 Now while* he was speaking, a certain Pharisee asked him, *that he might have supper with him, and having entered, he leaned-back <i>at the table.</i> 
11:38 Now when* the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first bathed himself before a meal. 
11:39 But the Lord said to him, <b>Now you*, the Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but the inside of you* is full from swindling and wickedness.</b> 
11:40 <b>Fools, he who made* the outside, did he not also make* the inside?</b>  
11:41 <b>However, the things which are within you*, give <i>those as</i> charity, and behold, all things are clean to you*.</b></p>
<p>11:42 <b>But woe to you* Pharisees! Because you* tithe mint and rue and every herb, and are passing over justice and the love* of God. These things you* ought to have done and not to leave the others <i>undone</i>.</b> 
11:43 <b>Woe to you* Pharisees! Because you* love* the foremost seat in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.</b> 
11:44 <b>Woe to you* scribes, and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you* are like the indistinct tombs, and the men who are walking upon <i>them</i> do not know <i>it</i>.</b></p>
<br>
<p>11:45 Now someone from the professors of the law, answered and says to him, Teacher, you are also insulting us in saying these things.</p>
<p>11:46 But he said, <b>Woe also to you* professors of the law! Because you* are loading men <i>down with</i> unbearable loads, and you* yourselves do not stroke the loads with one of your* fingers.</b> 
11:47 <b>Woe to you*! Because you* build the tombs of the prophets and your* fathers killed them.</b> 
11:48 <b>Consequently*, you* are testifying and consenting to the works of your* fathers, because they indeed killed them, and you* build their tombs.</b> 
11:49 <b>Because of this, the wisdom of God also said, I will send to them prophets and apostles, and <i>some</i> out of them they will kill and banish;</b> 
11:50 <b>that* the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the conception of the world, may be sought from this generation;</b> 
11:51 <b>from the blood of Abel</b> {Gen. 4:8} <b>to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the House <i>of the Lord</i>.</b> {Zech. 1:7?} <b>Yes, I say to you*, It will be sought from this generation.</b> 
11:52 <b>Woe to you* professors of the law! Because you* took away the key of knowledge. You* did not enter in yourselves, and you* forbid those who were entering.</b></p>
<br>
<p>11:53 Now <i>while</i> saying these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began terribly to hold <i>everything</i>  against <i>him</i>, and to quiz him <i>for unrehearsed answers</i> concerning many things; 
11:54 plotting against him, seeking to trap <i>him in</i> something out of his mouth, in order that they might accuse him.</p>

<p>{Similar: Mt 10:26-33, Lk 12:2-12}</p>
<p>12:1 At which <i>time</i>, when* ten-thousand from the crowd were gathered together, so-that they trampled down one another, he began to say to his disciples first, <b>Take-heed of yourselves of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</b></p>
<p>12:2 <b>But nothing is covered up, that will not be revealed; or secret, that will not be known.</b> 
12:3 <b>Because as many things as you* have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you* have spoken in the ear in the storerooms will be preached upon the housetops.</b></p>
<p>12:4 <b>But I am saying to you* my friends, Do not be afraid of those who kill the body and they do not have, after these things, anything more-than <i>that</i> to do <i>against you*</i>.</b> 
12:5 <b>But I will show you* whom you* should fear. Fear him, who after he has killed <i>you,</i> has authority to cast <i>you</i>* into hell. Yes, I say to you*, Fear him.</b></p>
<p>12:6 <b>Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? And not one out of them has been forgotten in God’s sight.</b> 
12:7 <b>But even the hairs of your* head have all been numbered. Therefore do not fear. You* carry more-value than many sparrows.</b></p>
<p>12:8 <b>Now I say to you*, Everyone– whomever confesses <i>to be</i> in me before men, the Son of Man will also confess <i>to be</i> in him before the messengers of God.</b>  
12:9 <b>But he who is denying me in the sight of men will be denied in the sight of the messengers of God.</b></p>
<p>12:10 <b>And everyone who will speak a <i>blasphemous</i> word at the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him, but to him who has blasphemed at the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.</b></p>
<p>12:11 <b>But whenever they bring you* in front of the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious <i>concerning</i> how, or what you* may <i>need to</i> make a defense, or what you* should say,</b> 
12:12 <b>for* the Holy Spirit will teach you* in that same hour what you* ought to say.</b></p>
<br>
<p>12:13 Now someone out of the crowd said to him, Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.</p>
<p>12:14 But he said to him, <b>Man, who designated me a justice or a divider over you?</b></p>
<p>12:15 Now he said to them, <b>See and guard yourselves from greed, because to not anyone is his life in <i>the</i> abundance of his possessions.</b></p>
<p>12:16 Now he spoke a parable to them, saying: <b>The region of a certain rich man was fertile;</b> 
12:17 <b>and he was reasoning in himself, saying, What should I do, because I have nowhere, <i>in which</i>, I will gather together my fruits?</b> 
12:18 <b>And he said, I will do this: I will take down my barns and build greater <i>ones.</i> And I will gather together there, all my fruits <i>of labor</i> and my good things.</b> 
12:19 <b>And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many good things laid up *for many years; rest yourself, eat, drink, <i>and</i> be joyous.</b></p>
<p>12:20 But God said to him, <b>Fool, your soul is asked back from you in this night, and the things which you prepared, whose will they be?</b> 
12:21 <b>So is he who is storing up <i>treasure</i> for himself, and <i>is</i> not rich toward God.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Similar: Mt 6:25-33, Lk 12:22-31}</p>
<p>12:22 Now he said to his disciples, <b>Because of this, I am saying to you*, Do not be anxious for your* life, what you* might eat; nor yet what you* might clothe <i>your</i>* body with.</b> 
12:23 <b>The life <i>you</i>* <i>have</i> is more-than the nourishment, and the body <i>is more-than</i> the clothing.</b> 
12:24 <b>Consider the ravens, that they do not sow nor reap; they have no storeroom nor a barn, and God nourishes them. How much more-value do you* carry than the birds!</b> 
12:25 <b>But which <i>one</i> out of you*, <i>by</i> being anxious, is able to add one cubit to his stature?</b>  
12:26 <b>Therefore, if you* are not able to do even what is least, why are you* anxious concerning the rest?</b> 
12:27 <b>Consider the lilies, somehow they grow. They do not labor nor do they spin; yet I say to you*, Even Solomon in all his glory, was not dressed like one of these.</b> 
12:28 <b>But if God so dresses-up the grass in the field, which today is <i>here</i> and the next-day is cast into the oven; how much more <i>will he clothe</i> you*, You* of small faith?</b> 
12:29 <b>And do not seek what you* might eat or what you* might drink, and do not be in <i>anxious</i> suspense.</b> 
12:30 <b>For* the nations of the world are seeking after all these things, but your* Father knows that you* have need of these things.</b> 
12:31 <b>However, seek the kingdom of God and all these things will be added to you*.</b> 
12:32 <b>Do not fear, little flock, because your* Father was delighted to give you* the kingdom.</b> 
12:33 <b>Sell your* possessions and give <i>as</i> charity; make* for yourselves money-bags which do not become-obsolete, an unfailing treasure in the heavens, where no thief draws near, nor moth corrupts.</b> 
12:34 <b>For* where your* treasure is, your* heart will be there also.</b></p>
<br>
<p>12:35 <b>Let your* loins be girded, and your* lamps burning;</b> 
12:36 <b>and you* yourselves are similar to men waiting for their lord, <i>as to</i> whenever he vacates from the marriage feast; that*, when he has come and knocks, they may immediately open to him.</b> 
12:37 <b>Those bondservants are fortunate, whom the lord, when* he comes, will find watching. Assuredly I am saying to you*, that he will gird himself, and have them recline <i>at the meal</i>, and will come and serve them.</b> 
12:38 <b>And if he comes in the second watch, and if in the third, and may find <i>them</i> so, those bondservants are fortunate<i>. </i> </b> 
12:39 <b>But know this, that if the householder knew in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have left his house <i>roof</i> to be burrowed through.</b> 
12:40 <b><i>You</i>* therefore, also become prepared, because in an hour that you* do not think the Son of Man is coming, <i>he comes</i>.</b></p>
<br>
<p>12:41 Now Peter said to him, Lord, do you speak this parable to us, or even to all?</p>
<p>12:42 But the Lord said, <b>Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom his lord will designate over his bondservants, to give them their food-allowance in season?</b> 
12:43 <b>That bondservant is fortunate, whom his lord will find so doing when he has come.</b> 
12:44 <b>Truly I say to you*, that he will designate him over all his possessions.</b> 
12:45 <b>But if that bondservant says in his heart, my lord delays his coming, and may begin to beat the young-servants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;</b> 
12:46 <b>the lord of that bondservant will come in a day in which he is not expecting, and in an hour in which he does not know, and will flog him and place his part with the unbelieving.</b> 
12:47 <b>But that bondservant, who knew his lord’s will and did not prepare, nor did according to his will, will be whipped <i>with</i> many <i>lashes</i>;</b> 
12:48 <b>but he who did not know and did things worthy of lashes, will be whipped <i>with</i> few lashes. But to whomever much is given, much will be required of him, and to whom they consign much, they will ask even-more of him.</b></p>
<br>
<p>12:49 <b>I came to cast fire into the earth, and what do I wish, if it is already lit?</b> 
12:50 <b>But I have an immersion* to be immersed* in, and how I am <i>so</i> troubled until it should be completed!</b> 
12:51 <b>You* are thinking that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you*, No, but rather division.</b> 
12:52 <b>For* there will be from hereafter five in one house having been divided, three against two, and two against three.</b> 
12:53 <b>Father will be divided against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</b></p>

<p>12:54 Now he also said to the crowds, <b>Whenever you* see the cloud rising from the west, immediately you* say, A thunderstorm is coming, and so it happens.</b> 
12:55 <b>And whenever <i>you</i>* <i>see</i> a south <i>wind</i> blowing, you* say, There will be a burning heat, and it happens.</b> 
12:56 <b>You* hypocrites, you* know <i>how</i> to decipher</b> {Greek: test} <b>the face of the earth and the heaven, but how do you* not decipher</b> {Greek: test<b>} this time?</b> 
12:57 <b>But why are you* not judging what is right, even from yourselves?</b> 
12:58 <b>For* as you are going on the road with your opponent <i>to be</i> in front of the ruler, work <i>hard</i></b> {Greek: give work} <b>to be set-free of him; lest he might drag you down to the judge and the judge might give you to the constable and the constable might cast you into prison.</b>

<h3>Luke 13</h3>
<p>13:1 Now there were some here at the same time reporting to him concerning the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 
13:2 And Jesus answered and said to them, <b>Do you* think that these Galileans became sinners above all the <i>other</i> Galileans, because they have suffered these things?</b> 
13:3  <b>I tell you*, No, but, if you* do not repent, you* will all likewise* perish.</b> 
13:4 <b>Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed, do you* think that those became debtors above all <i>other</i> men who are dwelling in Jerusalem?</b> 
13:5 <b>I tell you*, No, but, if you* do not repent, you* will all likewise perish.</b></p>
<br>
<p>13:6 Now he spoke this parable: <b>A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit in it and found none.</b> 
13:7 <b>Now he said to the vine-dresser, Behold three years, I come seeking fruit and find none in this fig tree. Cut it down. Why does it also do-away-with the <i>good</i> soil?</b></p>
<p>13:8 <b>But he answered and says to him, Lord, Also leave it this year, until I should dig around it and put in manure;</b> 
13:9 <b>and if it indeed produces fruit in the future, <i>good</i>; otherwise you will cut it down.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 13:10-17:10; Probably Peraea; no parallel. This is similar teaching but a different crowd.}</p>
<p>13:10 Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day. 
13:11 And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of sickness <i>for</i> eighteen years, and she was <i>always</i> stooped over and was not able to completely stand-erect. 
13:12 Now when* Jesus saw her, he summoned her and said to her, <b>Woman, you have been loosed from your sickness.</b> 
13:13 And he laid his hands upon her and instantly she was straightened and was glorifying God.</p>
<p>13:14 Now the ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, answered and said to the crowd, There are six days in which men ought to work; therefore be healed, coming in <i>here</i> these <i>days</i> and not on the day of the Sabbath.</p>
<p>13:15 Therefore the Lord answered him and said, <b>You* hypocrites, does not each of you* on the Sabbath loose his bull or his donkey from the manger and having led him away, give <i>it</i> a drink?</b> 
13:16 <b>Now this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom the Adversary had bound, behold, <i>these</i> eighteen years, is it not essential <i>for her</i> to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the Sabbath?</b></p>
<p>13:17 And <i>while</i> saying these things, all who laid in opposition to him, they were being shamed, and all the crowd was rejoicing at all the glorious things which happened by him.</p>
<br>
<p>{Similar: Mt 13:31-32, Mk 4:30-32, Lk 13:18-19}</p>
<p>13:18 Now he said, <b>The kingdom of God is similar to what? And what shall <i>I make</i> it similar to?</b> 
13:19 <b>It is similar to a kernel of a mustard-seed, which a man took and cast into his own garden, and it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the heaven nested in its branches.</b></p>
<p>13:20 Again he said, <b>The kingdom of God shall be similar to what?</b> 
13:21 <b>It is similar to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three three-gallon containers of flour, until it was entirely leavened.</b></p>

<p>13:22 And he was traveling throughout the cities and villages, teaching and making* his pursuit toward Jerusalem. 
13:23 Now someone said to him, Lord, if <i>only</i>  those few are saved?</p>
<p>But he said to them, 
13:24 <b>Struggle to enter in through the narrow gate, because I say to you*, Many will seek to enter in and will not be strong-enough.</b> 
13:25 <b>From whenever <i>time</i> the householder arose and locked the door and you*, <i>being</i> outside, may begin to stand and to knock on the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</b></p>
<p><b>And he will answer and say to you*, I do not know you* <i>or</i> where you* are from.</b></p>
<p>13:26 <b>Then you* will begin to say, We ate and drank in your sight and you taught in our streets.</b></p>
<p>13:27 <b>And he will say, I say to you*, I do not know you* <i>or</i> where you* are from. Withdraw from me, everyone– the workers of unrighteousness.</b> 
13:28 <b>The weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be there, whenever you* see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth outside.</b> 
13:29 <b>And they will come from <i>the</i> east and west and north and south, and will recline in the kingdom of God.</b> 
13:30 <b>And behold, there are last who will be first and there are first who will be last.</b></p>
<br>
<p>13:31 Some Pharisees came in that same day, saying to him, Come out and travel from here, because Herod wishes to kill you*.</p>
<p>13:32 And he said to them, <b>Travel <i>to</i> and say to that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform healings today and the next-day and I am completed in the third <i>day</i>.</b> 
13:33 <b>However it is essential <i>for</i> me to travel on today and the next-day and in the next <i>day</i>, because it is not acceptable <i>for</i> a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.</b></p>
<p>{Similar: Mt 23:37-39, Lk 13:34-35}</p>
<p>13:34 <b>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who have been sent to her! How-often I wished to have gathered your children together in the manner a bird <i>gathers</i> her own brood under her wings, and you* did not wish <i>for it</i>!</b>

<h3>Luke 14</h3>
<p>14:1 And it happened, while* he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they themselves were observing him. 
14:2 And behold, there was before him, a certain <i>man</i> having dropsy. 
14:3 And Jesus answered and spoke to the professors of the law and Pharisees, saying, <b>Is it legal to heal on the Sabbath?</b> 
14:4 But they were quiet. And he took him and healed him and dismissed him. 
14:5 And he answered and said to them, <b>Who <i>is it</i> of you*, <i>if</i> a son or a bull will fall into a well, and will not immediately pull him up on the Sabbath day?</b> 
14:6 And they are not strong-enough to answer back to him <i>as</i> to these things.</p>
<br>
<p>14:7 Now he spoke a parable to those who have been invited, when* he took-heed of how they were choosing for themselves out the foremost-places; saying to them: 
14:8 <b>Whenever you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, do not recline in the foremost seat; lest a more admired man <i>than</i> you may have been invited by him,</b>  
14:9 <b>and he who invited you and him will come and say to you, Give this one <i>your</i> place, and then you may begin with shame to hold the last place.</b> 
14:10 <b>But whenever you are invited, travel <i>there</i> and lean-back in the last place; that* whenever he who has invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go higher toward <i>me</i>, and then you will have glory in the sight of those who recline <i>at the table</i> together with you.</b> 
14:11 <b>Because everyone who is exalting himself will be humbled, and he who is humbling himself will be exalted.</b></p>
<br>
<p>14:12 Now he said to him, who has also invited him, <b>Whenever you make* a meal or a supper, do not summon your friends, nor your brethren, nor your relatives, nor rich neighbors; lest they may also invite you too and it might become a repayment for you.</b> 
14:13  <b>But whenever you make* a banquet, invite the poor, the disabled, the lame, the blind;</b> 
14:14 <b>and you will be fortunate, because they do not have <i>anything in which</i> to repay you; for* you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Similar: Mt 22:1-14, Lk 14:15-24}</p>
<p>14:15 Now when* someone from those who reclined <i>at the meal</i> together with him heard these things, he said to him, <i>He</i> who will eat bread in the kingdom of God is fortunate.</p>
<p>14:16 But he said to him, <b>A certain man made* a great supper, and he invited many;</b> 
14:17 <b>and he sent forth his bondservant in the hour of supper to say to those who have been invited, Come, because all things are already prepared.</b> 
14:18 <b>And they all, from one <i>desire</i>, began to excuse themselves. The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I have a necessity to go out and to see it; I request <i>of</i> you, have me excused.</b></p>
<p>14:19 <b>And a different <i>one</i> said, I have bought five yoke of bulls, and I <i>must</i> go-onward to test them; I request <i>of</i> you, have me excused.</b></p>
<p>14:20 <b>And a different <i>one</i> said, I have married a wife, and because of this, I am not able to come.</b> 
14:21 <b>And that bondservant came and reported to his lord these things. Then the householder, being angry, said to his bondservant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and lead the poor and disabled and lame and blind in here.</b></p>
<p>14:22 <b>And the bondservant said, Lord, it has happened as you commanded, and there is still a place <i>for more</i>.</b> 
14:23 <b>Now the lord said to the bondservant, Go out into the roads and <i>over the</i> fences, and urge <i>them</i> to enter, that* my house may be filled.</b> 
14:24 <b>For* I say to you*, that none of those men who have been invited will taste of my supper. For* many are invited but few chosen.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Similar: Mt 10:37-38, Lk 14:25-27}</p>
<p>14:25 Now large crowds were traveling together with him and he turned and said to them, 
14:26 <b>If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters, and also, still his own life, he is not able to be my disciple.</b>  
14:27 <b>And whoever does not bear his own cross, and come after me, is not able to be my disciple.</b></p>
<p>14:28 <b>For* which out of you*, wishing to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost, if he has the <i>means</i> toward <i>its</i> realization?</b> 
14:29 <b>Lest, when* he has laid a foundation and is not strong-enough to complete, all who view <i>it</i> may begin to mock him,</b> 
14:30 <b>saying, This one began to build and was not strong-enough to complete.</b></p>
<p>14:31 <b>Or what king, <i>while</i> traveling to encounter* a different king in war, will not sit down first and counsel if he is able at ten-thousand to encounter him who is coming against him with twenty thousand?</b> 
14:32 <b>Otherwise, <i>while</i> he is still faraway, having sent an ambassador, he asks for the <i>terms</i> of peace.</b> 
14:33 <b>Therefore, so everyone out of you* who does not bid farewell to all his possessions, he is not able to be my disciple.</b> 
14:34 <b>The salt is good, but if the salt is flavorless, in what shall it be seasoned?</b>

<p>15:1 Now all the tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to him to hear him. 
15:2 And the Pharisees and the scribes were murmuring, saying, This <i>man</i>  accepts sinners and eats together with them.</p>
<p>{Similar: Mt 18:12-14, Lk 15:3-7}</p>
<p>15:3 Now he spoke to them this parable, saying: 
15:4 <b>What man out of you*, having a hundred sheep and having lost one out of them, does not leave the ninety nine in the wilderness and travel to what is lost, until he should find it?</b> 
15:5 <b>And having found it, he places it upon his shoulders, rejoicing.</b> 
15:6 <b>And when* he comes to his house, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice together with me, because I have found my sheep which has been lost.</b> 
15:7  <b>I say to you* thus, that there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, <i>more</i> than over ninety nine righteous <i>ones</i>, who need no repentance.</b></p>
<p>15:8 <b>Or what woman having ten two-denarii coins, if she loses one two-denarii coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house, and seek carefully until she should find it?</b> 
15:9 <b>And having found it, she calls together her friends and her neighbors, saying, Rejoice together with me, because I have found the two-denarii coin which I had lost.</b> 
15:10 <b>Even so, I say to you*, There becomes joy in the sight of the messengers of God over one sinner who repents.</b></p>

<p>15:11 Now he said, <b>A certain man had two sons.</b> 
15:12 <b>And the younger of them said to <i>his</i> father, Father, give <i>me</i> the part of the estate <i>that would be</i> put <i>toward me</i>. And he sections off his livelihood to them.</b> 
15:13 <b>And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and went abroad into a far region, and he squandered his estate with riotous living there.</b> 
15:14  <b>Now having spent all, there became a mighty famine throughout that region, and he began to have lack <i>of things</i>.</b> 
15:15 <b>And he traveled and joined himself to one of the citizens of that region, and he sent him into his field to feed swine.</b> 
15:16 <b>And he was desiring to fill his belly from the carob pods that the swine were eating, and no one was giving <i>anything</i> to him.</b> 
15:17 <b>Now having come to himself, he said, How many of my father’s hired <i>servants</i> are abounding, <i>even</i> of bread? But I am perishing <i>here</i> in famine!</b> 
15:18 <b>I will stand up and travel to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned at heaven, and in your sight.</b> 
15:19 <b>I am no more worthy to be called your son. Make* me like one of your hired <i>servants.</i></b> 
15:20 <b>And standing up, he came to his father. But <i>while</i> he was still distant, far from <i>him</i>, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell upon his neck and kissed him.</b> 
15:21 <b>But the son said to him, Father, I have sinned at heaven, and in your sight. I am no more worthy to be called your son.</b></p>
<p>15:22 <b>But the father said to his bondservants, Bring out the foremost robe and clothe him, and give <i>him</i> a ring *for his hand and shoes *for his feet;</b> 
15:23 <b>and when* you* have brought the fattened calf, sacrifice <i>it</i>, and <i>when</i> eating <i>it,</i> we should be joyous.</b> 
15:24 <b>Because this <i>one</i>, my son, was dead and is alive again, and was perishing and is found. And they began to be joyous.</b>  
15:25 <b>Now his elder son was in the field and as he is coming, he drew near to the house, <i>and</i> he heard harmony and dancing.</b> 
15:26 <b>And he called to him one of the young-servants, and inquired what these things might be.</b></p>
<p>15:27 <b>But he said to him, Your brother is coming, and your father has sacrificed the fattened calf because he has received him <i>back</i> healthy.</b> 
15:28 <b>But he was angry and was not willing to enter and therefore his father came out and was pleading him.</b></p>
<p>15:29 <b>But he answered and said to <i>his</i> father, Behold, I <i>did</i> serve* you <i>for</i> so-many years, and I never* passed over a commandment of yours, and <i>yet</i> you never* gave me a <i>young</i> goat, that* I might be joyous with my friends.</b> 
15:30 <b>But when this your son came, who has devoured your livelihood with prostitutes, you sacrificed the fattened calf for him.</b></p>
<p>15:31 <b>Now he said to him, Child, you are always with me, and all the things <i>that are</i> mine is yours.</b> 
15:32 <b>But we ought to be joyous and rejoice, because this <i>one</i>, your brother was dead, and is alive again, and was perishing and is found.</b></p>
<h3>Luke 16</h3>
<p>16:1 Now he also said to his disciples, <b>There was a certain rich man, who had a steward, and he was indicted by him as <i>one</i> squandering his possessions.</b> 
16:2 <b>And having summoned him, he said to him, What is this that I am hearing concerning you? Give <i>me</i> the account of your stewardship; for* you are not able to be a steward any longer.</b></p>
<p>16:3 <b>But the steward said in himself, What should I do, because my lord is taking away the stewardship from me? I am not strong-enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg.</b> 
16:4 <b>I know what I should do, that* whenever I am removed <i>from</i> the stewardship, they may accept me into their houses.</b> 
16:5 <b>And calling to him each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first, How much do you owe to my lord?</b></p>
<p>16:6 <b>Now he said, A hundred eight-gallon containers of oil.</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>And he said to him, Take <i>out</i> your contract</b> {Greek: writings<b>} and sit down quickly and write fifty.</b></p>
<p>16:7 <b>Thereafter, he said to a different <i>one</i>, and how much do you owe?</b></p>
<p><b>Now he said, A hundred twelve-bushel containers of grain.</b></p>
<p><b>But he says to him, Accept your contract</b> {Greek: writings<b>} and write eighty.</b></p>
<p>16:8 <b>And his lord praised the steward of unrighteousness because he had done prudently, because the sons of this world are more prudent to their own generation; above the sons of the light.</b></p>
<p>16:9 <b>And I say to you*, Make* friends for yourselves out of the money of unrighteousness; that*, whenever it fails, they may accept you* into the everlasting tabernacles.</b> 
16:10 <b>He who is faithful in <i>the</i> least <i>matters</i> is also faithful in much, and he who is unrighteous in <i>the</i> least <i>matters</i> is also unrighteous in much.</b> 
16:11 <b>Therefore, if you* have not become faithful in the unrighteous money, who will entrust the true <i>riches</i> to you*?</b> 
16:12 <b>And if you* have not become faithful in what is another’s, who will give you* what is yours*?</b> 
16:13 <b>No domestic <i>servant</i> is able to serve* two lords; for* either he will hate the one and love* the other; for* either he will hold to one and despise the other. You* are not able to serve* God and money.</b></p>
<br>
<p>16:14 Now the Pharisees, who are* money-lovers, were also hearing all these things, and they were ridiculing him. 
16:15 And he said to them, <b>You* are those who are justifying yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your* hearts, because what is exalted among men <i>is</i> an abomination in God’s sight.</b></p>
<p>16:16 <b>The law and the prophets <i>were</i> until John; from that time the good-news of the kingdom of God is proclaimed, and everyone violently-enters into it.</b> 
16:17 <b>But it is easier <i>for</i> the heaven and the earth to pass away, than <i>for</i> one serif of the law to fall short.</b> 
16:18 <b>Everyone who divorces his wife and marries a different <i>one</i> is committing adultery, and everyone who marries <i>the</i> one who has been divorced from a husband, is committing adultery.</b> {Mt 5:32, 19:9}</p>
<br>
<p>16:19 <b>Now there was a certain rich man and he was clothing himself in purple and fine-linen, having been radiantly joyous daily.</b> 
16:20 <b>Now there was a certain poor <i>man,</i> Lazarus by name, who had been put at his gate, being full of sores,</b> 
16:21 <b>and desiring to be fed from the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. But even the dogs came and were licking his sores.</b> 
16:22  <b>Now it happened, that the poor <i>man</i> died and that he was carried away by the messengers into Abraham’s bosom, and the rich man also died and was buried.</b> 
16:23  <b>And in Hades, he lifted up his eyes being* in torments, and he sees Abraham from afar, and Lazarus in his bosom.</b></p>
<p>16:24 <b>And shouting, he said, Father Abraham, show-mercy to me, and send Lazarus that* he may dip the tip of his finger in water and may cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in this flame.</b></p>
<p>16:25 <b>But Abraham said, Child, remember that you received your good things in your life and Lazarus likewise evil things, but now he is comforted here and you are in anguish.</b> 
16:26 <b>And upon all things, a great chasm is established between us and you*, *that those who wish to cross over from here to you* may not be able, nor may they ferry over from there to us.</b> 
16:27 <b>But he said, Therefore I am requesting <i>from</i> you, father, that* you should send him to my father’s house;</b> 
16:28 <b>for* I have five brethren; *that he may thoroughly testify to them, in order that they may also not come into this place of torment.</b></p>
<p>16:29 <b>But Abraham says to him, They have Moses and the prophets. Let them hear them.</b></p>
<p>16:30 <b>But he said, No, father Abraham, but if someone travels to them from the dead, they will repent.</b></p>
<p>16:31 <b>But he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if someone rises* up from the dead.</b></p>
<h3>Luke 17</h3>
<p>17:1 Now he said to his disciples, <b>It is inevitable that offenses might come, but woe <i>to him</i>, through whom they come!</b> 
17:2 <b>It is beneficial for him if a millstone rotated by a donkey encompassed his neck, and he has been tossed into the sea, <i>rather</i> than that* he should offend one of these little ones.</b></p>
<p>17:3 <b>Take-heed to yourselves; and if your brother sins</b> {F} <b>against you, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.</b> 
17:4 <b>And if he</b> {F} <b>sins against you seven-times in the day, and should turn again to you seven-times in the day, saying, I repent. You will forgive him.</b></p>
<br>
<p>17:5 And the apostles said to the Lord, Add to our faith<b>.</b></p>
<p>17:6 Now the Lord said, <b>If you* have faith like a kernel of a mustard-seed, you* would say to this mulberry tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea, and it <i>would have</i> obeyed* you*.</b> 
17:7 <b>But which one out of you*, having a bondservant plowing or shepherding, will say <i>to him</i>, when* he has come in from the field, Come immediately and lean-back <i>at the table.</i></b> 
17:8 <b>But will you* not <i>rather</i> say to him, Prepare something <i>so</i> I may dine. And when* you gird yourself, serve me, until I eat and drink and you may eat and may drink after these things.</b> 
17:9 <b>He does not <i>give</i> gratitude to that bondservant because he did the things <i>that were</i> commanded him, does he? I think not.</b> 
17:10 <b>So also you*, whenever you* have done all the things <i>that were</i>  commanded to you*, say, We are useless bondservants, because we have done what we are obligated to have done.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 17:11-37; Borders of Samaria and Galilee; Lk 18:1-14; early 30 AD; no parallels.}</p>
<p>17:11 And it happened, while* he was traveling to Jerusalem, that he was going through <i>the</i> middle of Samaria and Galilee. 
17:12 And <i>while</i> entering into a certain village, ten men who were lepers encountered him there, who stood farther out; 
17:13 and they lifted up their voices, saying, Jesus, Master*, show-mercy to us.</p>
<p>17:14 And when* he saw them, he said to them, <b>When* you travel <i>back</i>, show yourselves to the priests.</b></p>
<p>And it happened, while* they were going, they were cleansed. 
17:15 Now one out of them, having seen that he was healed, turned back with a loud voice, glorifying God; 
17:16 and he fell upon his face beside his feet, giving-thanks to him, and he was a Samaritan.</p>
<p>17:17 But Jesus answered and said, <b>Were there not ten cleansed? But where <i>are</i> the nine?</b> 
17:18 <b>Was there no one found, except this immigrant, who returned to give glory to God?</b> 
17:19 And he said to him, <b>Stand and travel. Your faith has cured you.</b></p>
<br>
<p>17:20 And having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God is coming, he answered them and said, <b>The kingdom of God is not coming with observation;</b> 
17:21 <b>nor will they say, Behold, here! Or, behold there! For* behold, the kingdom of God is within you*.</b></p>
<br>
<p>17:22 Now he said to the disciples, <b>The days will come, when you* will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you* will not see it.</b> 
17:23 <b>And they will say to you*, Behold here! Behold there! Do not go away, nor should you* pursue <i>them</i>.</b> 
17:24 <b>For* just-like the lightning, which flashes from the <i>one end</i> under heaven, <i>and</i> shines to the <i>other end</i> under heaven; so will the Son of Man be in his day.</b> 
17:25 <b>But first it is essential for him to suffer many things and to be rejected* by this generation.</b> 
17:26 <b>And just-as it happened in the days of Noah, so it will also be in the days of the Son of Man.</b> 
17:27 <b>They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being betrothed, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.</b> 
17:28  <b>Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot; they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;</b> 
17:29 <b>but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.</b> 
17:30 <b>According to the same things, it will be in the day that the Son of Man is revealed.</b> 
17:31 <b>In that day, he who will be upon the housetop and <i>has</i> his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them up, and let him who is in the field, likewise do not turn behind <i>for them</i>.</b> 
17:32 <b>Remember Lot’s wife.</b>  {Gen 19:26} 
17:33 <b>Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses <i>it</i> will preserve <i>it</i>.</b> 
17:34 <b>I say to you*, There will be two men upon one bed in that night; the one will be taken and the other will be left.</b>  
17:35 <b>There will be two <i>women</i> grinding together; the one will be taken and the other will be left.</b> 
17:36 {T} <i><b>There will be two men in the field; the one will be taken and the other will be left.</b></i></p>
<p>17:37 And they answered and say to him, Where, Lord?</p>
<p>Now he said to them, <b>Where the body <i>is</i>, the vultures will also be gathered together there.</b></p>
<br>

<h3>Luke 18</h3>
<p>18:1 Now he also spoke a parable to them, to <i>show</i> that it is essential for them to always pray, and not to be depressed; 
18:2 saying: <b>A certain judge was in a certain city, who did not fear God and did not revere man.</b> 
18:3 <b>Now a widow was in that city, and she was coming often to him, saying, Avenge me of my opponent.</b> 
18:4 <b>And he did not wish to at <i>that</i> time, but after these things, he said in himself, Even if I do not fear God, and do not revere man;</b> 
18:5 <b>yet because this widow is harassing me, I will avenge her, in order that she may not pester me, coming <i>often</i> *for an end <i>of her opponent</i>.</b></p>
<p>18:6 But the Lord said, <b>Hear <i>with understanding</i> what the judge of the unrighteousness says <i>about himself</i>.</b></p>
<br>
<p>18:7 <b>Now, should God not do the avenging of his chosen who are crying to him day and night? Also, <i>should he not</i> have patience upon them?</b></p>
<p>18:8 <b>I say to you*, that he will do the avenging on them quickly.</b></p>
<p><b>However, when* the Son of Man comes, will he find then the faith upon the earth?</b></p>
<br>
<p>18:9 Now he spoke this parable to some who have confidence in themselves, that they were righteous, and scorning the rest: 
18:10 <b>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the <i>first</i> one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</b> 
18:11 <b>The Pharisee stood and was praying these things with himself, God, I give-thanks to you, that I am not like the rest of men: swindlers, unrighteous, adulterers or just-like this tax collector.</b>  
18:12 <b>I fast twice in the week; I tithe of all things, as many things as I procure.</b> 
18:13 <b>And the tax collector, standing from afar, was not even willing to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his chest, saying, God, be lenient to me, the sinner.</b> 
18:14 <b>I say to you*, This one went down to his house, having been justified <i>rather</i> than that <i>man</i>, because everyone who is exalting himself will be humbled, but he who is humbling himself will be exalted.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 10:13-16 &amp; Mt 19:13-15 &amp; Lk 18:15-17 Peraea.}</p>
<p>18:15 Now they were also bringing to him their babies, that* he might touch them, but when* the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 
18:16 But Jesus, having called them to him, said, <b>Allow the little children to come to me and do not forbid them; for* the kingdom of God is for such.</b> 
18:17 <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, Whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like a little child, he may never* enter into it.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 10:17-31 &amp; Mt 19:16-

<p>18:18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I practice to inherit everlasting life?</p>
<p>18:19 But Jesus said to him, <b>Why do you call* me good? None is good, except one, <i>our</i> God.</b> 
18:20 <b>You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery. Do not murder. Do not steal. Do not falsely testify. Honor your father and your mother.’</b> {Ex. 20:12-16 &amp; Deu. 5:16-20.}</p>
<p>18:21 But he said, I have observed all these things from my youth <i>up</i>.</p>
<p>18:22 Now having heard these things, Jesus said to him,  <b>One thing is still deficient for you. Sell all things, as many things as you have and distribute to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come-here. Follow me.</b> 
18:23 But when* he heard these things, he became very sorrowful; for* he was extremely rich. 
18:24 Now when* Jesus saw him, having become very sorrowful, he said, <b>How those who have wealth will hardly enter into the kingdom of God! 
18:25 For* it is easier <i>for</i> a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye, than <i>for</i> a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</b></p>
<p>18:26 Now those who heard it said, Then who is able to be saved?</p>
<p>18:27 But he said, <b>The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</b></p>
<p>18:28 But Peter said, Behold, we left all and followed you.</p>
<p>18:29 But he said to them, <b>Assuredly I am saying to you*, There is no one who has left <i>his</i> house or parents or brethren or children, because of the kingdom of God,</b> 
18:30 <b>who may not receive again much more in this time, and in the world to come, everlasting life.</b></p>

18:32 <b>For* he will be given up to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and insulted and spit on;</b> 
18:33 <b>and they will scourge and kill him, and he will rise* up in the third day.</b>

18:36 Now hearing a crowd traveling through, he inquired what this might be. 
18:37 Now they reported to him, that Jesus the Nazarene is passing by. 
18:38 And he cried <i>out</i>, saying, Jesus, son of David, show-mercy to me. 
18:39 And those who precede were rebuking him, that* he should be silent, but he was crying out much more, Son of David, show-mercy to me!</p>
<p>18:40 Now when* Jesus stood <i>still,</i> he commanded him to be led to him, and when* he drew near, he asked him, 
18:41 saying, <b>What do you wish that I might do for you?</b></p>
<p>But he said, Lord, that* I may recover my sight.</p>
<p>18:42 And Jesus said to him, <b>Recover your sight. Your faith has cured you.</b> 
18:43 And instantly he recovered his sight and was following him, glorifying God. And all the people, having seen it, gave praise to God.</p>

<p>19:1 And he entered, and was going through Jericho. 
19:2 And behold, a man called by <i>the</i> name Zacchaeus <i>was there</i> and he was a chief tax collector and he was rich. 
19:3 And he was seeking to see Jesus; who he is, and was not able from the crowd, because he was little in stature. 
19:4 And he ran ahead before <i>the crowd</i>, and goes up into a sycamore tree that* he might see him, because he was about to go through that <i>way</i>. 
19:5 And as Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him,  <b>Zacchaeus, hurry, come down; for* it is essential <i>for</i> me to abide in your house today.</b> 
19:6 And having hurried, he came down and accepted him, rejoicing.</p>
<p>19:7 And when* they saw it, they were all murmuring, saying, He has entered to board with a man <i>who is</i> a sinner.</p>
<p>19:8 Now Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I repay <i>them</i> quadruple.</p>
<p>19:9 Now Jesus said to him, <b>Today salvation has come* to this house, insomuch as he is also a son of Abraham.</b>

<br>
<p>{Similar: Mt 25:14-30, Lk 14:15-24}</p>
<p>19:11 Now when* they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and <i>because</i> they thought that the kingdom of God was about to instantly appear. 
19:12 Therefore he said: <b>A certain nobleman traveled into a far <i>away</i> region, to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.</b> 
19:13 <b>Now he called ten of his bondservants, and gave them ten two-hundred denarius coins, and said to them, Trade <i>with this</i> until I come.</b> 
19:14 <b>But his citizens were hating him and sent an ambassador after him, saying, We do not wish that this one reign over us.</b> 
19:15 <b>And it happened, while* he was coming back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these bondservants, to whom he gave the silver, to be summoned to him, that* he might know what they had made by trading.</b></p>
<p>19:16 <b>Now the first came before him, saying, Lord, your two-hundred denarius coin has <i>been</i> worked <i>up</i> to ten two-hundred denarius coins more.</b> 
19:17 <b>And he said to him, Well done, you good bondservant, because you became faithful in <i>the</i> least <i>matters</i>; be <i>the</i> authority over <i>these</i>, you have ten cities.</b> 
19:18 <b>And the second came, saying, Your two-hundred denarius coin, Lord, has made* five two-hundred denarius coins.</b> 
19:19 <b>But he also said to him, You, become <i>the authority</i> over five cities.</b> 
19:20 <b>And a different <i>bondservant</i> came, saying, Lord, behold, <i>here is</i> your two-hundred denarius coin, which I had laid up in a handkerchief;</b> 
19:21 <b>for* I was fearing you, because you are an austere man. You lift up <i>from</i> what you did not lay <i>down</i> and reap what you did not sow.</b></p>
<p>19:22 <b>But he says to him, I will judge you out of your own mouth, you evil bondservant. You knew that I am an austere man, lifting up <i>from</i> what I did not lay <i>down</i> and reaping what I did not sow?</b> 
19:23 <b>Then why did you not give my silver to <i>the</i> bank, and when* I came <i>back,</i> I might have appropriated it together with interest?</b></p>
<p>19:24 <b>And he said to those standing beside <i>him</i>, Take away the two-hundred denarius coin from him, and give <i>it</i> to him who has the ten two-hundred denarius coins.</b></p>
<p>19:25 <b>And they said to him, Lord, he has ten two-hundred denarius coins. <i>Why?</i></b></p>

<p>19:29 And it happened, as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, toward the mountain which is called Olives, he sent two of the disciples,

19:31 <b>And if anyone asks you*, Why are you* loosening him? You* will say to him thus, The Lord has need of him.</b>

19:37 Now <i>as he was</i> already drawing near, <i>even</i> to the slope of the Mountain of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began rejoicing, <i>and</i> to praise God with a loud voice concerning all the miracles which they had seen; 
19:38 saying, The King who is coming in the name of the Lord has been blessed; peace in heaven and glory in the highest.</p>

<p>19:40 And he answered and said to them, <b>I say to you*, that if these <i>disciples</i> are silent, <i>then</i> the stones will cry out.</b></p>
<br>
<p>19:41 And as he drew near, he saw the city and wept over it, 
19:42 saying, <b>If you had known in this day, even you, for-sure, the things <i>which are</i> for your peace! But now they are hid from your eyes.</b> 
19:43 <b>Because <i>the</i> days will come upon you, and your enemies will put a military-barrier around you and will surround you, and will crowd you on every-side,</b> 
19:44 <b>and will level you to the bedrock, and your children with* you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon <i>another</i> stone, because you did not know the time of your visitation.</b></p>

<p>19:45 And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out those <i>who were</i> selling and buying in it, 
19:46 saying to them, <b>It has been written, 'My house will be a house of prayer, but you* have made* it a den of robbers.’</b> {Isa 
56:7 &amp; Jer. 7:11} 
19:47 Now he was teaching daily in the temple. But the high-priests and the scribes and the foremost ones of the people were seeking to destroy him. 
19:48 And they were not finding what they might do; for* the people were all hanging on him, listening.</p>

<br>
<p>{Mk 11:27-33 &amp; Mt 21:23-27 &amp; Lk 20:1-8 Courtyard of the Temple, Tues.}</p>
<p>20:1 And it happened on one of those days, while* he is teaching the people in the temple and proclaiming the good-news, the priests and the scribes, together with the elders stood up; 
20:2 and they spoke saying to him, Tell us, by what authority are you doing these things? Or who is he who gave you this authority?</p>
<p>20:3 But he answered and said to them, <b>I will also ask you* one question, and tell me.</b> 
20:4 <b>The immersion* of John, was it from heaven or from men?</b></p>
<p>20:5 Now they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we should say, From heaven; he will say, Then why did you* not believe him? 
20:6 But if we say, From men; all the people will stone us; for* they have confidence that John was a prophet. 
20:7 And they answered that they did not know where <i>it was</i> from.</p>
<p>20:8 And Jesus said to them, <b>Neither do I tell you* by what authority I am doing these things.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 12:1-12 &amp; Mt 21:33-46 &amp; Lk 20:9-19.}</p>
<p>20:9 Now he began to speak to the people this parable:  <b>A man planted a vineyard and rented it to farmers, and went abroad for a considerable time.</b> 
20:10 <b>And in the <i>harvest</i> season, he sent a bondservant to the farmers, that* they might give to him from the fruit of the vineyard, but the farmers whipped him and sent him away empty <i>handed</i>.</b> 
20:11 <b>And he sent yet a different bondservant, and they also whipped and dishonored him, and sent him away empty</b>. 
20:12 <b>And he sent yet a third, and they also traumatized him and cast him forth.</b> 
20:13 <b>But the lord of the vineyard said, What should I do? I will send my beloved son; perchance seeing <i>him</i>, they will revere him.</b> 
20:14 <b>But when* the farmers saw him, they were reasoning with themselves, saying, This is the heir. Come-here. We should kill him, that* the inheritance may become ours.</b> 
20:15 <b>And they cast him forth outside the vineyard, and killed him. Therefore, what will the lord of the vineyard do to them?</b> 
20:16 <b>He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.</b></p>
<p>But when* they heard it, they said, Let it not happen!</p>
<p>20:17 But he looked at them and said, <b>Then* what is this that has been written, ‘The stone which the builders rejected*, this one has become the head of the corner'?</b> {Psa 118:22} 
20:18 <b>Everyone who falls upon that stone will be shattered, but <i>upon</i> whomever it falls, it will smash him.</b></p>
<p>20:19 And the high-priests and the scribes sought to put hands upon him in that same hour and <i>yet</i> they feared <i>the people</i>; for* they knew that he spoke this parable to them.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 12:13-17 &amp; Mt 22:15-22 &amp; Lk 20:20-26 Courtyard of the Temple, Tues.}</p>
<p>20:20 And having observed him, they sent forth agents, who themselves pretended to be righteous, that* they might grab him from his speech, *that* they might give him to the rule and to the authority of the governor. 
20:21 And they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that you say and teach correctly, and do not accept the countenance <i>of men</i>, but in truth, are teaching the way of God. 
20:22 Is it legal for us to give tax to Caesar or not?</p>
<p>20:23 But he perceived their craftiness and said to them, <b>Why are you* testing me?</b> 
20:24 <b>Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription has it?</b></p>
<p>But they answered and said, Caesar’s.</p>
<p>20:25 But he said to them, <b>Now-then, give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.</b> 
20:26 And they were not strong-enough to grasp his declaration in front of the people, and they marveled at his answer and were silent.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 12:18-27 &amp; Mt 22:23-33 &amp; Lk 20:27-39.}</p>
<p>20:27 Now some of the Sadducees came to him, those who contradict that there is a resurrection; 
20:28 and they asked him, saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, that* if anyone’s brother dies, who had a wife, and he should die childless, his brother should take the wife and should raise* up seed to his brother. {Deu. 25:5} 
20:29 Therefore, there were seven brethren, and the first took a wife and died childless; 
20:30 and the second took the woman and he died childless; 
20:31 and the third took her, and likewise*, the seven also left no children and died. 
20:32 The woman also died later. 
20:33 Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife of them does she become? For* the seven had her <i>as</i> wife.</p>
<p>20:34 And Jesus answered and said to them, <b>The sons of this world marry and are betrothed.</b> 
20:35 <b>But those who are deemed worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are they betrothed,</b> 
20:36 <b>for* neither are they able to die anymore; for* they are equal to the messengers, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</b> 
20:37 <b>But that the dead are raised, even Moses divulged in <i>the place concerning</i> the bush, as he calls* the Lord, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</b> {Ex. 3:6} 
20:38 <b>Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for* all live to him.</b></p>
<p>20:39 But some of the scribes answered and said, Teacher, you have said well.</p>
<p>{Mk 12:28-34 &amp; Mt 22:34-40 &amp; Lk 20:40.}</p>
<p>20:40 But they were not daring anymore to ask him anything.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 12:35-37 &amp; Mt 22:41-46 &amp; Lk 20:41-44.}</p>
<p>20:41 Now he said to them, <b>How <i>is it that</i> they say the Christ is David’s son?</b> 
20:42 <b>And David himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right <i>hand</i>,</b> 
20:43 <b>until I should place your enemies <i>as the</i> footstool of your feet.</b> {Psa 110:1} 
20:44 <b>Therefore, David calls him Lord, and <i>so</i> how is he his son?</b></p>
<p>{Mk 12:38-40 &amp; Mt 23:1-39 &amp; Lk 20:45-47 Courts of the Temple, Tues.}</p>
<p>20:45 But he said to his disciples, <i>with</i> all the people hearing <i>this</i>, 
20:46 <b>Take-heed of the scribes, who wish to walk in <i>long</i> robes and love greetings in the marketplaces and foremost seats in the synagogues and foremost-places in the suppers;</b> 
20:47 <b>who are devouring widow’s houses, and are praying long <i>prayers</i> for a pretext. These will receive even-more condemnation.</b></p>

<p>{Mk 12:41-44 &amp; Lk 21:1-4 In the Temple Treasury, Tues.}</p>
<p>21:1 Now he looked up and saw the rich <i>men</i> casting their gifts into the treasury. 
21:2 But he also saw a certain poor widow casting two bronze-coins in there. 
21:3 And he said, <b>Truly I say to you*, This poor widow cast in more-than they all.</b> 
21:4 <b>For* all these cast into the gifts of God out of what is abounding to them, but she cast in out of her lacking, all the livelihood that she had.</b></p>

<p>21:5 And while* some are speaking about the temple, how it has been adorned with beautiful stones and votive-offerings, he said, 
21:6 <b><i>As for</i> these things which you* are viewing, <i>the</i> days will come in which <i>one</i> stone will not be left here upon <i>another</i> stone, that will not be torn-down.</b></p>
<p>21:7 Now they asked him, saying, Therefore teacher, when will these things be? And what <i>will be</i> the sign whenever these things are about to happen?</p>
<p>21:8 And he said, <b>Beware, <i>that</i> you* should not be misled; for* many will come in my name, saying, I am <i>he</i>, and, The time has drawn near. You* therefore, do not travel after them.</b> 
21:9 <b>But whenever you* hear of wars and unrest, do not be terrified; for* it is necessary <i>for</i> these things to happen first, but the end <i>is</i> not immediately <i>here</i>.</b></p>
<p>21:10 Then he said to them, <b>Nation will arise against nation and kingdom against kingdom;</b> 
21:11 <b>and there will be great earthquakes in <i>different</i> places and famines and plagues. There will be both terrors and great signs from heaven.</b> 
21:12 <b>But before all these things, they will put their hands upon you* and will persecute you*, giving you* up to the synagogues and prisons, leading <i>you</i>* in front of kings and governors because of my name.</b> 
21:13 <b>But it will transpire into a testimony for you*.</b> 
21:14 <b>Therefore place <i>it</i> into your* hearts, not to meditate beforehand how to make a defense.</b> 
21:15 <b>For* I will give you* a mouth and wisdom, which all who lay in opposition to you* will not be able to stand against, nor to speak against.</b> 
21:16 <b>But you* will be given up even by parents and brethren and relatives and friends, and they will slay <i>some</i> out of you*.</b> 
21:17 <b>And you* will be hated by all men because of my name.</b> 
21:18 <b>And a hair out of your* head may never* perish.</b> 
21:19 <b><i>You* will</i> procure your* souls in your* endurance.</b></p>
<p>21:20 <b>But whenever you* behold Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies, then know that her desolation has drawn near.</b> 
21:21 <b>Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are in the midst of her vacate, and do not let those who are in the region enter in it.</b> 
21:22 <b>Because these are days of vengeance, that all things which have been written may be fulfilled.</b> 
21:23 <b>But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing in those days! For* a great calamity will be upon the land, and wrath among this people.</b> 
21:24 <b>And they will fall by the edge of the sword and will be captured into all the nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles should be fulfilled.</b></p>

<p>22:1 Now the feast of unleavened bread was drawing near, which is called* the Passover.

<p>{Mk 14:10-11 &amp; Mt 26:14-16 &amp; Lk 22:3-6 &amp; Jn 12:2-8.}</p>
<p>22:3 Now the Adversary entered into Judas who is surnamed Iscariot, being out of the number of the twelve. 
22:4 And he went away and spoke together with the high-priests and magistrates, how he might give him to them. 
22:5 And they rejoiced and covenanted to give him silver. 
22:6 And he professed <i>agreement</i>, and was seeking an opportunity to give him up to them without <i>the</i> crowd.</p>
<br>

<p>22:7 Now the day of unleavened bread came, in which the Passover ought to be sacrificed. 
22:8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, <b>Go-onward, <i>and</i> prepare the Passover for us, that* we may eat.</b></p>
<p>22:9 Now they said to him, Where do you will that we shall prepare <i>it</i>?</p>
<p>22:10 But he said to them <b>Behold, when* you* have entered into the city, a man bearing a pitcher of water will meet you* there; follow him into the house where he enters.</b> 
22:11 <b>And you* will say to the householder, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guestroom, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?</b> 
22:12  <b>And he will show you* a big furnished upper room. Prepare <i>it</i> there.</b> 
22:13 Now they went and found just-as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.</p>
<br>
<p>22:14 And when the hour came*, he leaned-back, and the twelve apostles together with him. 
22:15 And he said to them, <b>I have desired with <i>a great</i> desire, to eat this Passover with you* before I suffer;</b> 
22:16 <b>for* I say to you*, I may never* eat from it anymore, until it should be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</b></p>
<p>22:17 And he accepted a cup, and having given-thanks, he said, <b>Take this and divide it among yourselves.</b>

22:23 And they began to debate together with themselves, who then it might be out of them who is about to do this thing.</p>
<br>
<p>{See Lk 22:24-30 above.}</p>
<p>22:24 Now there happened <i>to be</i> also contention among them, which of them is thought to be the greater. 
22:25 But he said to them, <b>The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors.</b> 
22:26 <b>But you* <i>will</i> not <i>be</i> so, but he who is the greater among you*, let him become like the younger, and he who is leader, as he who is serving.</b> 
22:27 <b>For* what <i>is</i> greater, he who reclines <i>at the meal</i>, or he who is serving? Is <i>it</i> not he who reclines? But I am in your* midst like he who serves.</b> 
22:28 <b>But you* are those who have remained with me in my temptations;</b>

<p>{See Lk 22:31-38 above.}</p>
<p>22:31 Now the Lord said, <b>Simon, Simon, behold, the Adversary asked for you*, to sift <i>you</i>* like wheat.</b> 
22:32  <b>But I besought concerning you, that* your faith may not fail, and someday you have turned again, establish your brethren.</b></p>
<p>22:33 But he said to him, Lord, I am ready to travel with you both to prison and to death.</p>
<p>22:34 But he said, <b>I tell you Peter, The rooster may never* crow today, before you will deny knowing me three-times.</b></p>

<p>And they said, Nothing.</p>
<p>22:36 Therefore he said to them, <b>But now, he who has a money-bag, let him take it and likewise a knapsack, and he who has no sword, he will sell his garment and buy one.</b>

<p>22:39 And he, coming out and according to his custom, traveled to the Mountain of Olives, and his disciples also followed him. 
22:40 Now when* he came* on the place, he said to them, <b>Pray that you* do not enter into temptation.</b> 
22:41 And he pulled away from them approximately a stone’s throw, and having placed <i>himself on his</i> knees, he was praying, 
22:42 saying, <b>Father, if you are willing to carry this cup away from me, but not my will, but let yours happen.</b> 
22:43 Now a messenger from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. 
22:44 And having become in agony, he was praying more intensely, and his sweat became like thick drops of blood going down upon the soil. 
22:45 And when* he rose* up from his prayer, he came to the disciples and found that they had fallen-asleep from sorrow,

<p>22:51 But Jesus answered and said, <b>Permit this.</b> And he touched his ear and healed him.</p>

22:68 <b>and if I also ask, you* may never* answer or release <i>me</i>.</b> 
22:69 <b>From hereafter, the Son of Man will be seated at <i>the</i> right <i>hand</i> of the power of God.</b></p>
<p>22:70 Now they all said, Then* are you the Son of God?</p>
<p>But he said to them, <b>You* are saying that I am.</b></p>
<p>22:71 Now they said, Why do we still have need of testimony? For* we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.</p>
<h3>Luke 23</h3>
<p>23:1 And the whole multitude of them stood up and led him in front of Pilate.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 15:2-5 &amp; Mt 27:11-14 &amp; Lk 23:2-5 &amp; Jn 18:28b-38 Jerusalem early Friday morning.}</p>
<p>23:2 Now they began to accuse him, saying, We found this one perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.</p>
<p>23:3 But Pilate asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews?</p>
<p>Now he answered and said to him, <b>You say <i>correctly</i>.</b></p>
<p>23:4 Now Pilate said to the high-priests and the crowds, I am finding no crime in this man.</p>
<p>23:5 But they were insisting, saying, He is shaking up the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea and beginning from Galilee, <i>even</i> to here.</p>
<p>{Lk 23:6-12 Jerusalem early Friday morning; no parallel.}</p>
<p>23:6 But when* Pilate heard it, he asked if the man was a Galilean. 
23:7 And when he recognized that he is out of Herod’s authority, he sent him back to Herod, who himself was also in Jerusalem in these days.</p>
<br>
<p>23:8 Now when Herod saw Jesus, he rejoiced exceedingly; for* he was wishing <i>for</i> a considerable <i>time</i> to see him, because he <i>had</i> heard many things concerning him, and he was hoping to see some sign happening by him. 
23:9 Now he asked him <i>questions</i> with* considerable words, but he answered him nothing.</p>
<p>23:10 Now the high-priests and the scribes stood, intensely accusing him.</p>
<p>23:11 Now Herod, together with his soldiers, having scorned and having mocked <i>him</i>, and having dressed him in bright apparel, sent him back to Pilate.</p>
<p>23:12 Now Pilate and Herod became friends with one another in that same day; for* they were formerly being at enmity toward themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>23:13 Now Pilate called together the high-priests and the rulers and the people, 
23:14 and said to them, You* brought this man to me, as one turning away the people <i>to riot</i>, and behold, I have examined him in your* sight, <i>and</i> found no crime in this man of which you* accuse against him. 
23:15 But even Herod <i>found nothing</i>. For* he sent him back to you*, and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by him. 
23:16 Therefore, <i>after</i> having disciplined him, I will release <i>him</i>. 
23:17 But, he had to release to them one prisoner at the feast <i>by</i> necessity.</p>
<p>23:18 But they cried out altogether, saying, Take away this one and release Barabbas to us. 
23:19 <i>He was one</i> who has been cast into prison because of a certain riot, which happened in the city, and <i>for</i> murder.</p>
<p>23:20 Therefore Pilate shouted to <i>them</i> again, wishing to release Jesus.</p>
<p>23:21 But they were shouting out, saying, Crucify <i>him</i>! Crucify him!</p>
<p>23:22 Now he said to them the third-time, For* what evil has this one done? I have found no crime <i>worthy</i> of death in him; therefore, <i>after</i> having disciplined him, I will release <i>him</i>. 
23:23 But they were urgently asking with loud voices, that he might be crucified. And their voices and <i>those</i> of the high-priests were prevailing. 
23:24 But Pilate decided their request <i>was</i> to happen. 
23:25 Now he released <i>to them</i> he who has been cast into the prison because of riot and murder, whom they asked for, but Jesus he gave up to their will.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 15:20-23 &amp; Mt 27:31-34 &amp; Lk 23:26-33 &amp; Jn 
19:17 Road to the Cross, Friday morning.}</p>
<p>23:26 And as they led him away, they grabbed someone <i>named</i> Simon from Cyrene, coming from the rural-area, and they laid the cross on him to carry it behind Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>23:27 Now a large multitude of the people, and of women, were also following him. They were grieving and mourning <i>for</i> him. 
23:28 But Jesus, turning to them, said,  <b>Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep on me, however, weep on yourselves and on your* children.</b> 
23:29 <b>Because behold, the days are coming in which they will say, The barren are fortunate and <i>the</i> wombs that did not give-birth and the breasts that did not nurse.</b> 
23:30 <b>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us, and to the hills, Hide us.</b> 
23:31 <b>Because if they are doing these things in the green tree, what might happen in the dry?</b></p>
<br>
<p>23:32 Now two others, also criminals, were being led together with him to be taken away.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 15:24-32 &amp; Mt 27:35-44 &amp; Lk 23:33-43 &amp; Jn 19:18-27 
9:00 until Noon, Friday.}</p>
<p>23:33 And when they came upon the place which is called The Skull, they crucified him and the criminals there, one at <i>the</i> right and the other at <i>the</i> left.</p>
<p>23:34 Now Jesus said, <b>Father, forgive them; for* they do not know what they are doing</b>.</p>
<p>‘Now they cast a lot, dividing his garments among them.’ {Psa 22:18} 
23:35 And the people stood viewing and the rulers together with them were also ridiculing <i>him</i>, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen.</p>
<p>23:36 Now the soldiers were also mocking him, coming to him and offering him vinegar, 
23:37 and saying, If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself. 
23:38 Now an inscription was also over him, having been written in <i>the</i> alphabet of Greek and Latin and Hebrew, This is the King of the Jews.</p>
<br>
<p>23:39 Now one of the criminals who hung <i>there</i>, was blaspheming him, saying, If you are the Christ save yourself and us!</p>
<p>23:40 But, the other answered and was rebuking him, saying, Do you not fear even God, because you are in the same condemnation? 
23:41 And we indeed <i>suffer</i> righteously; for* we are receiving worthy <i>payment</i> of what we practiced, but this one practiced nothing improper.</p>
<p>23:42 And he said, Jesus, remember me Lord, whenever you come in your kingdom.</p>
<p>23:43 And he said to him, <b>Assuredly I am saying to you, Today you will be with me in Paradise.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 
15:34 &amp; Mt

<p>23:44 Now it was approximately the sixth hour and there became darkness upon the whole earth until the ninth hour {i.e. Noon to 
3:00 PM}.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 15:34-41 &amp; Mt 27:46-56 &amp; Lk 23:45-49 &amp; Jn 19:28-30 around 
5:00 PM.}</p>
<p>23:45 And the sun was darkened and the curtain of the temple was split-apart in the middle. 
23:46 And Jesus having shouted with a loud voice, said, <b>Father, I will consign my spirit into your hands.</b> And having said these things, he expired.</p>
<p>23:47 Now when* the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, This was really a righteous man. 
23:48 And all the crowds that came together upon this scene, viewing the things that had happened, were returning, beating their chest.</p>
<p>23:49 Now all his acquaintances and the women who followed from Galilee together with him, stood from afar, seeing these things.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 15:42-47 &amp; Mt 27:57-66 &amp; Lk 23:50-56 &amp; Jn 19:31-42 Before The Sabbath.}</p>
<p>23:50 And behold, a man, Joseph by name, who is* a counselor, a good and righteous man 
23:51 (he was not in alliance with their counsel and practice), <i>a man</i> from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God. 
23:52 This one, having gone to Pilate, asked for the body of Jesus. 
23:53 And having taken it down, he entwined it in a linen cloth and laid it in a hewed out tomb, where no one had yet laid.</p>
<p>23:54 Now it was the day of the Preparation and the Sabbath was dawning. 
23:55 Now having followed after, <i>the</i> women, who were coming together to him, out of Galilee, and were seeing the tomb and how his body was laid.</p>
<p>23:56 Now they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And on the Sabbath they relaxed according to the commandment.</p>
<h3>Luke 24</h3>
<p>{Mk 16:1-8 &amp; Mt 28:1-8 &amp; Lk 24:1-8, 12 &amp; Jn 20:1-10 Dawn and very early Sunday.}</p>
<p>24:1 Now on the first <i>day</i> of the week, from the deep <i>fog</i> of daybreak, they and some <i>others</i> together with them came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared. 
24:2 Now they found the stone has been rolled away from the tomb. 
24:3 And they entered in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 
24:4 And it happened, while* they are perplexed concerning this, behold, two men stood by them in flashing <i>white</i> apparel. 
24:5 Now when* they became fearful and bowed <i>their</i> faces down to the earth, they said to them, Why are you* seeking the living with the dead? 
24:6 He is not here, but was raised. <i>Do you*</i> remember how he spoke to you*, being still in Galilee, 
24:7 saying that it is essential <i>for</i> the Son of Man to be given up into the hands of sinful men and to be crucified and to rise* up in the third day? 
24:8 And they remembered his declarations.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 16:9-11 &amp; Mt 28:9-10 &amp; Lk 24:9-11 &amp; Jn 20:11-18.}</p>
<p>24:9 And they returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. 
24:10 Now those who were saying these things to the apostles were: Mary the Magdalene and Joanna and Mary <i>the mother</i> of James and the rest of the women together with them. 
24:11 And their declarations appeared like nonsense in their sight, and they were disbelieving them. 
24:12 But Peter stood up and ran to the tomb, and stooping down and looking in, he sees the linen-strips laying alone, and he went away to his <i>home</i>, marveling at what has happened.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 16:12-13 &amp; Lk 24:13-35 &amp; 1Cor: 
15:5 Sunday Afternoon.}</p>
<p>24:13 And behold, two out of them were traveling that same day to a village whose name <i>was</i> Emmaus, which was sixty furlongs distant from Jerusalem. 
24:14 And they were conversing with one another concerning all these things which have befallen <i>them</i>. 
24:15 And it happened, while* they are conversing and debating together, that Jesus himself drew near and was traveling together with them. 
24:16 But their eyes were being held-fast <i>so as</i> not to recognize him. 
24:17 But he said to them, <b>What words <i>are</i> these which you* are exchanging <i>back and forth</i> with one another, <i>while</i> walking? and you* have a gloomy face, <i>why</i>?</b></p>
<p>24:18 But one whose name <i>was</i> Cleopas answered and said to him, Are you sojourning alone in Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened in her in these days?</p>
<p>24:19 And he said to them, <b>What things?</b></p>
<p>But they said to him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who became a prophet mighty in works and word in front of God and all the people; 
24:20 and how the high-priests and our rulers gave him up to <i>the</i> condemnation of death and crucified him. 
24:21 Now we were hoping that he was <i>the one</i> who is about to redeem Israel. But today, even together with all these things, is bringing* <i>us</i> the third day since these things happened. 
24:22 But some women from <i>among</i> us also astonished us, having happened <i>to be</i> at the tomb at daybreak, 
24:23 and having not found his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of messengers, who said that he was alive. 
24:24 And some of those who were together with us, went to the tomb and also found it just-as the women had said, but they did not see him.</p>
<p>24:25 And he said to them, <b>O <i>you*</i> foolish <i>ones</i> and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</b> 
24:26 <b>Was it not essential for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?</b> 
24:27 And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he was clarifying for them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. 
24:28 And they drew near to the village, where they were traveling and he was making-like he was <i>even</i> traveling farther.</p>
<p>24:29 And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us, because it is toward dusk and the day is far-spent. And he entered in to abide together with them. 
24:30 And it happened, while* he was reclining with them <i>at the table</i>, <i>and</i> having taken the bread, he gave-thanks and breaking <i>it</i> he was giving <i>it</i> to them.</p>
<p>24:31 Now their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he became unapparent from them. 
24:32 And they said to one another, Were our hearts not burning in<i>side</i> us, as he was speaking to us on the road, and as he was opening the Scriptures to us?</p>
<p>24:33 And that same hour they stood up and returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven and those who have been accumulated together with them, 
24:34 saying, The Lord was really raised and has appeared to Simon. 
24:35 And they were describing the things <i>that happened</i> on the road and how he was known by them in the breaking of the bread.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 
16:14 &amp; Lk 24:36-43 &amp; Jn 20:19-25 Sunday Evening.}</p>
<p>24:36 Now while* they are speaking these things, Jesus stood in the midst of them and says to them, <b>Peace <i>be</i> to you*.</b> 
24:37 But they became terrified and fearful and were thinking that they had viewed a spirit. 
24:38 And he said to them, <b>Why are you* disturbed? And why do questions come up in your* hearts?</b> 
24:39 <b>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones, like you* view me having.</b> 
24:40 And having said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. 
24:41 But {F} still disbelieving this from joy and marveling; he said to them, <b>Do you* have anything edible here?</b> 
24:42 Now they gave part of a broiled fish to him and part of the honeycomb. 
24:43 And he took and ate <i>it</i> in their sight.</p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 24:44-49 &amp; Acts 1:3-8 &amp; 1Cor: 
15:7 Jerusalem.}</p>
<p>24:44 Now he said to them, <b>These are the words which I spoke to you*, being still together with you*, that it is essential <i>for</i> all things to be fulfilled, which have been written in the Law of Moses and the prophets and the Psalms, concerning me.</b> 
24:45 Then he opened their mind, that they might understand the Scriptures.</p>
<p>{Mk 16:15-18 &amp; Mt 28:18-20 &amp; Lk 24:46-47 Mountain in Galilee; The Great Commission.}</p>
<p>24:46 And he said to them, <b>Thus it has been written, that it was essential <i>for</i> the Christ to suffer and to rise* up from the dead in the third day;</b> {Isa 53:5?} 
24:47 <b>and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</b> 
24:48 <b>Now you* are witnesses of these things.</b> 
24:49 <b>And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you*, but you* stick-around in the city of Jerusalem, until you* should be clothed with power from on high.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 16:19-20 &amp; Lk 24:50-53 &amp; Acts 1:9-12 Olivet, between Jerusalem and Bethany.}</p>
<p>24:50 Now he led them outside until <i>they were</i> in Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them. 
24:51 And it happened, while* he blesses them, he stood away from them and was being carried up into heaven. 
24:52 And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy 
24:53 and they were always in the temple, praising and thanking God.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

<h3>John 1</h3>
<p>{Jn 1:1-18 Jesus’ Deity; see also Php 2:6, Gen 1:26.}</p>
<p>1:1 In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. 
1:2 The same was in the beginning with God. 
1:3 All things became through him, and without him nothing became that has become <i>into being</i>. 
1:4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 
1:5 And the light is appearing in the darkness, and the darkness did not overtake {Or: comprehend} it.</p>
<p>1:6 It happened <i>that</i> a man <i>came</i>, having been sent from God, <i>and</i> his name was John. 
1:7 The same came to <i>be</i> a witness, that* he might testify concerning the light, that* all might believe through him. 
1:8 That <i>man</i> was not the light, but <i>came</i> that* he might testify concerning the light.</p>
<p>1:9 He was the true light coming into the world, <i>the light</i> which illuminates every man. 
1:10 He was in the world and the world became through him and the world did not know him.</p>
<p>1:11 He came to his own and those who were his own did not receive him. 
1:12 But as many as received him, he gave to them the authority to become children of God, to those who believe in his name, 
1:13 who were born, not from bloods, nor from the will of the flesh, nor from the will of man, but from God.</p>
<p>1:14 And the Word became flesh and resided among us (and we saw his glory, glory like <i>that</i> of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth. 
1:15 John testifies concerning him and has cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He who is coming after me, has become before me, because he was first, <i>then</i> me. 
1:16 And we all received out of his fullness and grace in exchange-for grace. 
1:17 Because the law was given through Moses; the grace and the truth became through Jesus Christ. 
1:18 No one has seen God at anytime; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, that one has described <i>him</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>{Jn 1:19-34 Bethany beyond Jordan, Feb. 27 AD; no parallel.}</p>
<p>1:19 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem that* they might ask him, Who are you?</p>
<p>1:20 And he confessed and did not deny, and he confessed, I am not the Christ.</p>
<p>1:21 And they asked him, Then*, what? Are you Elijah?</p>
<p>And he says, I am not.</p>
<p>Are you the prophet?</p>
<p>And he answered, No.</p>
<p>1:22 Therefore they said to him, Who are you? That* we might give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say of yourself?</p>
<p>1:23 He said, I am <i>the</i> voice of one crying in the wilderness. Make straight the way of the Lord, just-as Isaiah the prophet said.</p>
<p>1:24 And those who had been sent, were from the Pharisees. 
1:25 And they asked him, and said to him, Then* why do you immerse*, if you are not the Christ, neither Elijah, nor the prophet?</p>
<p>1:26 John answered them, saying, I immerse* in water, <i>but</i> one is standing in your* midst whom you* do not know. 
1:27 It is he who is coming after me, who has become before me. I am not worthy that* I should loose the strap of his shoes. 
1:28 These things happened in Bethany beyond-that <i>area</i> of the Jordan, where John was immersing*.</p>
<br>
<p>1:29 On the next-day he sees Jesus coming to him and says, Behold, the Lamb of God, who is taking away the sin of the world! 
1:30 This is he, concerning whom I said, After me is coming a man who has become before me, because he was first; <i>then</i> me. 
1:31 And I did not know him, but that* he should be manifested to Israel. I came immersing* in water because of this. 
1:32 And John testified, saying, I have seen the Spirit coming down like a dove from heaven, and it remained upon him. 
1:33 And I did not know him, but he who sent me to immerse* in water, that one said to me, <b>Upon whomever you see the Spirit coming down and remaining upon him, this one is he who immerses* in the Holy Spirit.</b> 
1:34 And I have seen, and have testified, that this is the Son of God.</p>
<br>
<p>{Jn 1:35-51 Bethany beyond Jordan, Spring 27 AD.}</p>
<p>1:35 Again on the next-day, John and two <i>others</i> from his disciples stood <i>around</i>. 
1:36 And having looked at Jesus walking, he says, Behold, the Lamb of God! 
1:37 And the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus.</p>
<p>1:38 Now Jesus, having turned, saw them following, and says to them, <b>What are you* seeking?</b></p>
<p>But they said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, by translation: Teacher), where do you abide?</p>
<p>1:39 He says to them, <b>Come and see.</b></p>
<p>They went and saw where he abode, and they remained with him that day. It was approximately the tenth hour. 
1:40 One from the two who heard <i>this</i> from John was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother and he followed him. 
1:41 He finds first his own brother Simon and says to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, <i>after</i> being translated, The Christ).</p>
<p>1:42 And he led him to Jesus. Now Jesus looked at him and said, <b>You are Simon, the Son of Jonah, you will be called Cephas,</b> which is by translation, a Pebble.</p>
<br>
<p>1:43 On the next-day, he wished to go out into Galilee, and he finds Philip, and Jesus says to him, <b>Follow me</b>.</p>
<p>1:44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, from the city of Andrew and Peter. 
1:45 Philip finds Nathanael and says to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law and the prophets wrote, Jesus the Nazarene, the son of Joseph.</p>
<p>1:46 And Nathanael said to him, Is any good thing able to be <i>coming</i> out of Nazareth?</p>
<p>Philip says to him, Come and see.</p>
<p>1:47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and says concerning him, <b>Behold, truly an Israelite in whom <i>there</i> is no treachery!</b></p>
<p>1:48 Nathanael says to him, From where do you know me?</p>
<p>Jesus answered and said to him, <b>Before Philip summoned you, I saw you when* you were under the fig tree</b>.</p>
<p>1:49 Nathanael answered and says to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.</p>
<p>1:50 Jesus answered and said to him, <b><i>Is it</i> because I said to you, I saw you underneath the fig tree <i>that</i> you believe? You will see greater things <i>than</i> these.</b> 
1:51 And he says to him, <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, From now <i>on</i>, you* will see the heaven has opened, and the messengers of God ascending and coming down upon the Son of Man.</b></p>
<h3>John 2</h3>
<p>{Jn 2:1-11 Cana in Galilee; no parallel.}</p>
<p>2:1 And in the third day, there happened <i>to be</i> a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there; 
2:2 and Jesus was also invited to the marriage and his disciples. 
2:3 And coming-short of wine, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.</p>
<p>2:4 Jesus says to her, <b>What <i>is this</i> to me and you, woman? My hour does not come yet.</b></p>
<p>2:5 His mother says to the servants, If he says anything to you*, do <i>it</i>. 
2:6 Now six stone water pots were placed there according to the Jews’ cleansing, making room <i>for</i> two or three nine-gallon measures apiece.</p>
<p>2:7 Jesus says to them, <b>Fill the water pots with water.</b>  And they filled them to the top. 
2:8 And he says to them, <b>Dip-out <i>some</i> now and carry <i>it</i> to the chief waiter.</b></p>
<p>And they carried <i>it</i>. 
2:9 Now as the chief waiter tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know where it is from (but the servants that had dipped-out the water knew), the chief waiter summons the bridegroom, 
2:10 and says to him, Every man first places the good wine <i>on the table</i>, and whenever they are drunken, then <i>the</i> inferior. <i>But</i> you have kept the good wine until now. 
2:11 This <i>was</i> the beginning of the signs <i>which</i> Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</p>
<br>
<p>{Jn 
2:12 Capernaum; no parallel.}</p>
<p>2:12 After this, he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples, and they did not abide there many days.</p>
<br>
<p>{Jn 2:13-25 Jerusalem April 9, 27 AD; no parallel.}</p>
<p>2:13 And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
2:14 And he found in the temple those who sold bulls and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting <i>there</i>. 
2:15 And he made* a scourge from ropes and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the bulls, and he poured out the coinage of the brokers and turned over their tables; 
2:16 and to those selling the doves he said, <b>Take these things from here. Do not make* my Father’s house a house of merchandise.</b></p>
<p>2:17 Now his disciples remembered that it has been written, ‘Zeal of your house will eat me up.’ {Psa 69:9}</p>
<p>2:18 Therefore, the Jews answered and said to him, What sign are you showing to us? <i>Why is it</i> that you are doing these things?</p>
<p>2:19 Jesus answered and said to them, <b>Tear-down this temple and I will lift it up in three days.</b></p>
<p>2:20 Therefore the Jews said, This temple was forty-six years in building and you will lift it up in three days? 
2:21 But that <i>man</i> spoke concerning the temple of his body. 
2:22 Therefore, when he was raised <i>up</i> from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spoke this, and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.</p>
<br>
<p>2:23 Now as he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, many believed in his name at the feast, viewing his signs which he was doing. 
2:24 But Jesus himself was not entrusting himself to them, because he knew all <i>men,</i> 
2:25 and because he had no need that* anyone should testify concerning man; for* he himself knew what was in man.</p>
<h3>John 3</h3>
<p>{Jn 3:1-21; no parallel.}</p>
<p>3:1 Now there was a man from the Pharisees, Nicodemus by name, a ruler of the Jews. 
3:2 This one came to <i>Jesus</i> by night and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God; for* no one is able to do these signs that you are doing, if God is not with him.</p>
<p>3:3 Jesus answered and said to him, <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you, If someone has not been born anew, he is not able to see the kingdom of God.</b></p>
<p>3:4 Nicodemus says to him, How is a man able to be born when* he is elderly? He is not able to enter into his mother’s womb a second-time and to be born <i>again</i>, is he?</p>
<p>3:5 Jesus answered, <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you, If someone has not been born out of water and the Spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God!</b> 
3:6 <b>What has been born from the flesh is flesh, and what has been born from the Spirit is spirit.</b> 
3:7 <b>Do not marvel that I said to you, It is essential for you* to be born anew.</b> 
3:8 <b>The Spirit is blowing where he wills and you hear his voice, but do not know from where he is coming and where he is going, so is everyone who has been born from the Spirit.</b></p>
<p>3:9 Nicodemus answered and said to him, How are these things able to happen?</p>
<p>3:10 Jesus answered and said to him, <b>Are you the teacher of Israel and do not know these things?</b> 
3:11  <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you, We speak what we know, and testify from what we have seen, and you* do not receive our testimony.</b> 
3:12 <b>If I told you* earthly things and you* do not believe, how will you* believe if I tell you* heavenly things?</b> 
3:13 <b>And no one has ascended into heaven, except he who came down from heaven, <i>that is</i>, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.</b>  
3:14 <b>And just-as Moses who exalted the serpent in the wilderness, so it is essential <i>for</i> the Son of Man to also be exalted;</b> 
3:15 <b>in order that everyone who believes in him might not perish but may have everlasting life.</b></p>
<br>
<p>3:16 <b>For* God so loved* the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, in order that everyone who believes in him might not perish, but may have everlasting life.</b> 
3:17 <b>For* God did not send the Son into the world in order that he might judge the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.</b> 
3:18 <b>He who believes in him is not judged. He who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</b></p>
<p>3:19 <b>Now this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world and men loved* the darkness rather <i>than</i> the light; for* their works were evil.</b> 
3:20 <b>For* everyone who is practicing evil, hates the light, and is not coming to the light, in order that his works should not convict <i>him</i>.</b> 
3:21 <b>But he who practices the truth comes to the light, that* his works should be manifest, that they have been worked in God.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Jn 3:22-36 Judea and Aenon; no parallel.}</p>
<p>3:22 After these things, Jesus and his disciples came into the land of <i>the</i> Jews, and he was remaining with them and was immersing* <i>there</i>. 
3:23 Now John was also immersing* in Aenon near to Salem, because many <i>bodies of</i> water were there, and they were coming and were being immersed*. 
3:24 For* John was not yet cast into prison. 
3:25 Therefore there happened <i>to be</i> a debate from John’s disciples with a Jew concerning the cleansing. 
3:26 And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with you beyond-that <i>area</i> of the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, This one immerses* and all men are going to him.</p>
<p>3:27 John answered and said, A man is able to receive nothing, if it is not given to him from heaven. 
3:28 You* yourselves testify, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I have been sent before him. 
3:29 He who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, who is standing and hearing him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore <i>in</i> this, my joy has been fulfilled. 
3:30 It is essential <i>for</i> that to grow, but <i>for</i> me to be diminished.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>3:31 He who is coming from above is over all. He who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks from the earth. He who is coming from heaven is over all. 
3:32 And what he has seen and heard, he is testifying of that, and no one receives his testimony. 
3:33 He who has received his testimony has sealed <i>this</i>: that God is true. 
3:34 For* he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for* God does not give the Spirit by measure. 
3:35 The Father loves* the Son, and has given all things into his hand. 
3:36 He who believes in the Son has everlasting life, but he who is disobedient to the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God is remaining upon him.</p>
<h3>John 4</h3>
<p>{Mk 1:14a &amp; Mt 
4:12 &amp; Lk 3:19-20 &amp; Jn 4:1-4 Judea to Galilee.}</p>
<p>4:1 Therefore as the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus is making* and immersing* more disciples than John, 
4:2 (although Jesus himself was not immersing*, but his disciples <i>did</i>), 
4:3 he left Judea and went away into Galilee.</p>
<br>
<p>4:4 Now it was essential for him to go through Samaria.</p>
<p>{Jn 4:5-43 Jacob’s Well and at Sychar; no parallel.}</p>
<p>4:5 So he comes to a city of Samaria, called* Sychar, close to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph, 
4:6 and Jacob’s well was there. Therefore, Jesus, being fatigued from his journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was approximately the sixth hour {i.e. Noon}. 
4:7 A woman from Samaria comes to dip-out water. Jesus says to her, <b>Give me <i>water</i> to drink.</b> 
4:8 For* his disciples had gone away into the city, that* they might buy nourishment.</p>
<p>4:9 Therefore the Samaritan woman says to him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, who is a Samaritan woman? (For* Jews have no dealings together with Samaritans.)</p>
<p>4:10 Jesus answered and said to her, <b>If you knew the gift of God and who it is that says to you, Give me <i>water</i> to drink; you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.</b></p>
<p>4:11 The woman says to him, Lord, you have no bucket and the well is deep. Therefore from where do you have living water? 
4:12 You are not greater <i>than</i> our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank out of it himself and his sons and his livestock, are you?</p>
<p>4:13 Jesus answered and said to her, <b>Everyone who drinks from this water will be thirsty again</b> 
4:14 <b>but whoever is drinking from the water that I will give him may never* be thirsty, but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water leaping up to everlasting life.</b></p>
<p>4:15 The woman says to him, Lord, give me this water, that* I may not be thirsty, nor come all the way here to dip-out <i>water</i>.</p>
<p>4:16 Jesus says to her, <b>Go, summon your husband, and come here.</b></p>
<p>4:17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband.</p>
<p>Jesus says to her, <b>You said well, I have no husband</b> 
4:18 <b>for* you had five husbands, and he whom you have now is not your husband. You have said this truly.</b></p>
<p>4:19 The woman says to him, Lord, I view that you are a prophet. 
4:20 Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you* <i>Jews</i> say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</p>
<p>4:21 Jesus says to her, <b>Woman, believe me, the hour is coming, when you* will worship the Father, neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem.</b> 
4:22 <b>You* worship what you* do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews.</b> 
4:23 <b>But the hour is coming and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for* the Father is seeking such who are worshiping him.</b> 
4:24 <b>God is a Spirit, and it is essential <i>for</i> those who are worshiping him to worship in spirit and truth.</b></p>
<p>4:25 The woman says to him, I know that <i>the</i> Messiah is coming (he who is called* Christ). Whenever he has come, that <i>man</i> will proclaim all things to us.</p>
<p>4:26 Jesus says to her, <b>I am <i>he</i>, who is speaking to you.</b></p>
<br>
<p>4:27 And his disciples came upon this, and marveled that he was speaking with a woman; nevertheless, no one said, What are you seeking? Or, Why are you talking with her?</p>
<p>4:28 So the woman left her water pot and went away into the city, and says to the people, 
4:29 Come-here. See a man who told me all things, as many things as I have done. This is not the Christ, is it? 
4:30 They went out of the city and were coming to him.</p>
<p>4:31 But in the <i>time in</i> between, the disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</p>
<p>4:32 But he said to them, <b>I have food to eat that you* do not know</b>.</p>
<p>4:33 Therefore the disciples were saying to one another, Someone did not bring him <i>anything</i> to eat, did they?</p>
<p>4:34 Jesus says to them, <b>My food is that* I should be doing the will of him who sent me, and should complete his work.</b> 
4:35 <b>Do you not say, There are still four months and <i>then</i> comes the harvest. Behold, I say to you*, Lift up your* eyes and look at the farmlands, because they are already white for <i>the</i> harvest.</b> 
4:36 <b>And he who is reaping receives wages and gathers fruit to everlasting life; that* he who is sowing and he who is reaping may rejoice in unison.</b> 
4:37 <b>For* in this is the true word, One is sowing and another is reaping.</b> 
4:38 <b>I sent you* to reap what you* have not labored; others have labored, and you* have entered into their labor.</b></p>
<p>4:39 Now many out of the Samaritans from that city believed in him, because of the word of the woman, <i>who was</i> testifying, He told me all things, as many things as I have done. 
4:40 Therefore, as the Samaritans came to him, they requested him to abide with them, and he remained there two days. 
4:41 And many more believed because of his word; 
4:42 and they were saying to the woman, We believe no longer because of your speech; for* we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is truly the Savior of the world, the Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>4:43 Now after the two days, he went forth from there and went into Galilee. 
4:44 For* Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own fatherland.</p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 4:14a &amp; Jn 4:44-45 Arrival in Galilee.}</p>
<p>4:45 So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans accepted him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast; for* they had also gone to the feast.</p>
<br>
<p>{Jn 4:46-54 Cana; no parallel.}</p>
<p>4:46 Therefore, Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee, where he made* the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick in Capernaum. 
4:47 Having heard that Jesus is coming out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and asked him that* he might come down and might heal his son; for* he was about to die. 
4:48 Therefore Jesus said to him, <b>If you* do not see signs and wonders, you* may never* believe.</b></p>
<p>4:49 The nobleman says to him, Lord, come down <i>here</i> before my child dies.</p>
<p>4:50 Jesus says to him, <b>Travel; your son lives.</b></p>
<p>And the man believed the word in which Jesus spoke to him, and he was traveling <i>onward</i>.</p>
<p>4:51 Now while* he was going down, already his bondservants encountered him and reported, saying, that his boy lives. 
4:52 Therefore, he inquired from them the hour in which he had improved. And they said to him, Yesterday, <i>in the</i> seventh hour, the fever left him. 
4:53 Therefore the father knew that <i>it was</i> in that hour in which Jesus said to him, <b>Your son lives.</b> And he himself, and his whole house believed. 
4:54 This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.</p>
<h3>John 5</h3>
<p>{Jn 5:1-47 Jerusalem probably the Passover; no parallel.}</p>
<p>5:1 The feast of the Jews was after these things, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
5:2 Now in Jerusalem, by the sheep <i>gate,</i> there is a pool called* in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches. 
5:3 A large multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, dried up, were laying in these <i>porches</i> waiting for the moving of the water. 
5:4 For* a messenger was going down from time to time in the pool, and was disturbing the water. Therefore, he who stepped in first after the disturbance of the water became healthy, from whatever disease he was being held <i>by</i>.</p>
<p>5:5 Now a certain man was there, who had been thirty eight years in sickness. 
5:6 When* Jesus saw him laying and having known that he had already been <i>there</i> a long time, he says to him, <b>Do you wish to become healthy?</b></p>
<p>5:7 The sick man answered him, Lord, I do not have a man, that* he might put me in the pool whenever the water is disturbed. But while* I am coming, another is going down before me.</p>
<p>5:8 Jesus says to him, <b>Arise, lift up your pallet and walk.</b> 
5:9 And immediately the man became healthy, and lifted up his pallet and was walking.</p>
<p>Now on that day, it was the Sabbath. 
5:10 So the Jews were saying to him who had been healed, It is the Sabbath. It is not legal for you to lift up your pallet.</p>
<p>5:11 He answered them, He who made* me healthy, that <i>man</i> said to me, Lift up your pallet and walk.</p>
<p>5:12 Therefore they asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Lift up your pallet and walk? 
5:13 But he who was healed did not know who it was; for* Jesus had slipped out of <i>the</i> crowd <i>that</i> was in that place.</p>
<p>5:14 After these things, Jesus finds him in the temple and said to him, <b>Behold, you have become healthy. Sin no longer, in order that something worse might not happen to you.</b> 
5:15 The man went away and reported to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made* him healthy. 
5:16 And because of this, the Jews were persecuting Jesus, and were seeking to kill him, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.</p>
<br>
<p>5:17 But Jesus answered them, <b>My Father works until now, and I work.</b> 
5:18 Then*, because of this, the Jews were seeking <i>even</i> more to kill him, because he was not only tearing-down the Sabbath, but also called* God his own Father, making* himself equal <i>to</i> God.</p>
<br>
<p>5:19 Therefore, Jesus answered and said to them,  <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, The Son is not able to do anything from himself, if he does not see what the Father is doing; for* whatever things that <i>one</i> does, the Son is also doing these things likewise.</b> 
5:20 <b>For* the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does, and greater works <i>than</i> these he will show him, that* you* may marvel.</b> 
5:21 <b>For* just-like the Father raises <i>up</i> the dead and is giving-life to them, so the Son also is giving-life to whom he wills.</b> 
5:22 <b>For* the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son;</b> 
5:23 <b>that* all may honor the Son, just-as they are honoring the Father. He who is not honoring the Son, does not honor the Father who sent him.</b></p>
<p>5:24 <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, He who hears my word and believes in him who sent me, has everlasting life, and does not come into judgment, but has stepped out of death into life.</b></p>
<p>5:25 <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, The hour is coming and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.</b> 
5:26 <b>For* just-like the Father has life in himself, so he also gave to the Son, to have life in himself,</b> 
5:27 <b>and he also gave him authority to make* judgment, because he is a son of man.</b> 
5:28 <b>Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice,</b> 
5:29 <b>and will travel out; those who have practiced good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</b></p>
<br>
<p>5:30 <b>I am able to do nothing of myself. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous, because I am not seeking my own will, but the will of the Father who sent me.</b> 
5:31 <b>If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true.</b> 
5:32 <b>It is another who is testifying concerning me, and I know that the testimony which he is testifying concerning me is true.</b> 
5:33 <b>You* have sent <i>people</i> to John, and he has testified to the truth.</b>  
5:34 <b>But the testimony which I receive is not from man, but I am saying these things, in order that you* might save yourselves.</b> 
5:35 <b>He was that lamp which burns and appears <i>bright</i>, and you* were willing to be glad for a season in his light.</b> 
5:36 <b>But the testimony which I have is greater <i>than</i> John’s; for* the works which the Father gave me, that* I should complete, the same works which I am doing, testify concerning me, that the Father has sent me.</b> 
5:37 <b>And the Father who sent me, he has testified concerning me. You* have neither heard his voice at anytime, nor has seen his form.</b> 
5:38 <b>And you* do not have his word remaining in you*, because you* do not believe that <i>one</i> whom he sent.</b> 
5:39  <b>You* are searching the Scriptures because you* think that in them you* have everlasting life, and these are those which are testifying concerning me;</b> 
5:40 <b>and you* are not willing to come to me, that* you* may have life.</b></p>
<p>5:41 <b>I am not receiving glory from men.</b> 
5:42 <b>But I know you*, that you* do not have the love* of God in yourselves.</b> 
5:43 <b>I have come in my Father’s name, and you* are not receiving me. If another comes in his own name, you* will receive that <i>man</i>.</b> 
5:44 <b>How are you* able to believe, who receive glory from one another, and <i>yet</i> you* are not seeking the glory that <i>comes</i> from the only God?</b> 
5:45 <b>Do not think that I will accuse you* to the Father. There is one who is accusing you*, Moses, in whom you* have hoped.</b> 
5:46 <b>For* if you* believed Moses, you* would believe me; for* that <i>man</i> wrote concerning me.</b> 
5:47 <b>But if you* do not believe the Scriptures of that <i>man</i>, how will you* believe my declarations?</b></p>
<h3>John 6</h3>
<p>{Mk 6:30-32 &amp; Mt 
14:13 &amp; Lk 
9:10 &amp; Jn 
6:1 East shore of Galilee.}</p>
<p>6:1 After these things, Jesus went away to the <i>area</i> beyond-that of the sea of Galilee, which is <i>the sea</i> of Tiberias.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 6:33-44 &amp; Mt 14:13-21 &amp; Lk 9:11-17 &amp; Jn 6:2-14.}</p>
<p>6:2 And a large crowd was following him, because they were seeing the signs from him which he was doing upon those who were sick.</p>
<p>6:3 Now Jesus went up into the mountain and was sitting there with his disciples. 
6:4 Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near. 
6:5 Therefore Jesus, having lifted up his eyes and having seen that a large crowd is coming to him, says to Philip, <b>From where will we buy bread, that* these might eat?</b> 
6:6 But he said this, testing him; for* he himself knew what he was about to do.</p>
<p>6:7 Philip answered him, Two hundred denarii’ <i>worth</i> of loaves is not enough for them, that* each of them might take some bit.</p>
<p>6:8 One out of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, says to him, 
6:9 There is one child here, who has five barley loaves and two little-fish, but what are these among so-many?</p>
<p>6:10 But Jesus said, <b>Make* the people lean-back.</b> Now much grass was in the place. So the men reclined, approximately five thousand in number. 
6:11 Now Jesus took the loaves, and having given-thanks, he distributed <i>it</i> to the disciples and <i>then</i> to the disciples who had reclined; also likewise from the little-fish as many as they were wishing <i>to eat</i>. 
6:12 Now as they were <i>getting</i> filled, he says to his disciples, <b>Gather up the broken pieces which was leftover, that* not anything might perish.</b> 
6:13 Therefore they gathered together and filled twelve baskets from <i>the</i> broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were leftover by those who had been fed.</p>
<p>6:14 Therefore, when* the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they were saying, This truly is the prophet who is coming into the world.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 6:45-56 &amp; Mt 14:22-36 &amp; Jn 6:15-21.}</p>
<p>6:15 Therefore Jesus, having known that they are about to come and seize him, that* they might make* him king, departed by himself into the mountain alone.</p>
<br>
<p>6:16 Now as it became evening, his disciples went down to the sea; 
6:17 and having stepped into the ship and they were going beyond-that <i>area</i> of the sea to Capernaum. And it had already become dark and Jesus had not <i>yet</i> come to them. 
6:18 And the sea was being aroused <i>by</i> a great blowing wind. 
6:19 Therefore, having rowed approximately twenty five or thirty furlongs, they view Jesus walking upon the sea and happening <i>to be</i> near the ship and they were afraid. 
6:20 But he says to them, <b>I am <i>here</i>. Do not be afraid.</b> 
6:21 Therefore they were willing to receive him into the ship and immediately the ship happened <i>to be</i> at the land where they were going.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>{Jn 6:22-71 Synagogue in Capernaum; no parallel.}</p>
<p>6:22 On the next-day the crowd which is standing beyond-that <i>area</i> of the sea, saw that no other small-boat was there, except this one which his disciples had stepped into, and that Jesus did not go together with his disciples into the small-boat, but his disciples alone 
6:23 (but other small-boats came from Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given-thanks). 
6:24 Therefore, when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves also stepped into the ships and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. 
6:25 And when* they found him beyond-that <i>area</i> of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when did you come* here?</p>
<p>6:26 Jesus answered them and said, <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, You* are seeking me, not because you* saw signs, but because you* ate from the loaves and were fed.</b> 
6:27 <b>Do not work <i>for</i> the food which perishes, but <i>for</i> the food which remains to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give to you*; for* him, God, the Father has sealed.</b></p>
<p>6:28 Therefore they said to him, What should we do, in order that we may work the works of God?</p>
<p>6:29 Jesus answered and said to them, <b>This is the work of God, in order that you* might believe in him whom that one has sent</b>.</p>
<p>6:30 Therefore they said to him, Then* what are you doing for a sign, that* we may see <i>it</i> and should believe you? What are you working <i>for us</i>? 
6:31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. {Ex. 16:21, Num. 11:8}</p>
<p>6:32 Therefore Jesus said to them, <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, It was not Moses who had given you* the bread from heaven, but my Father who is giving you* the true bread from heaven.</b> 
6:33 <b>For* the bread of God is what is coming down from heaven and is giving life to the world.</b></p>
<p>6:34 Therefore they said to him, Lord, give us this bread always.</p>
<p>6:35 But Jesus said to them, <b>I am the bread of life. He who is coming to me may never* hunger and he who believes in me may never* be thirsty at anytime.</b> 
6:36 <b>But I said to you*, That you* have seen me and yet do not believe.</b> 
6:37 <b>All that the Father gives me will come to me, and him who is coming to me I may never* cast outside.</b> 
6:38 <b>Because I have come down from heaven, not that* I should do my own will, but <i>do</i> the will of him who sent me.</b> 
6:39 <b>But this is the will of my Father who sent me, that* of all that he has given me, I should not lose any out of it, but should raise* it up in the last day.</b> 
6:40 <b>But this is the will of him who sent me, that* everyone who views the Son and believes in him, may have everlasting life, and I will raise* him up in the last day.</b></p>
<br>
<p>6:41 Therefore the Jews were murmuring concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven. 
6:42 And they were saying, Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, I have come down from heaven?</p>
<p>6:43 Therefore Jesus answered and said to them, <b>Do not murmur among yourselves.</b> 
6:44 <b>No one is able to come to me, if the Father who sent me does not attract him and I will raise* him up in the last day.</b> 
6:45 <b>It is written in the prophets, ‘And they will all be <i>the</i> taught from God.’</b> {Isa 54:13} <b>Therefore, everyone who hears from the Father and has learned, is coming to me.</b> 
6:46 <b>Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God, he has seen the Father.</b> 
6:47 <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, He who believes in me has everlasting life.</b> 
6:48 <b>I am the bread of life.</b> 
6:49 <b>Your* fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died.</b>  
6:50 <b>This is the bread which is coming down from heaven, that* anyone may eat from it and may not die.</b> 
6:51 <b>I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever and also the bread which I will give is my flesh, which I will give on behalf of the life of the world.</b></p>
<p>6:52 Therefore the Jews were quarreling with one another, saying, How is this one able to give us his flesh to eat?</p>
<p>6:53 Therefore Jesus said to them, <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, If you* do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you* do not have life in yourselves.</b> 
6:54 <b>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and I will raise* him up in the last day.</b> 
6:55 <b>For* my flesh is truly food and my blood is truly drink.</b> 
6:56 <b>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me and I in him.</b> 
6:57 <b>Just-as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father; so he who eats me, he will also live because of me.</b> 
6:58 <b>This is the bread which came down from heaven not like the manna your fathers ate and died; he who is eating this bread will live forever.</b> 
6:59 He said these things in the synagogue, (teaching in Capernaum).</p>
<p>6:60 Therefore many out of his disciples, having heard <i>this</i>, said, This is a hard speech; who is able to hear it?</p>
<p>6:61 But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured concerning this, said to them, <b>Is this offending you*?</b> 
6:62 <b>Then* <i>what</i> if you* view the Son of Man ascending where he was beforehand?</b> 
6:63 <b>It is the spirit who is giving-life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you* are spirit, are life.</b> 
6:64 <b>But there are some out of you* who do not believe.</b> For* Jesus knew from the beginning who they are who do not believe and who is he who will give him up. 
6:65 And he said, <b>Because of this, I have said to you*, that no one is able to come to me, if it has not been given to him from my Father.</b></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>6:66 From that <i>time</i>, many of his disciples went behind <i>them</i> and were walking no more with him. 
6:67 Therefore Jesus said to the twelve, <b>You* will not also go away, will you*?</b></p>
<p>6:68 Therefore Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom will we go? You have the words of everlasting life. 
6:69 And we have believed and know that you are the Christ the Son of the living God.</p>
<p>6:70 He answered them, <b>Did I not choose you* the twelve and one out of you* is a slanderer?</b> 
6:71 Now he was speaking of Judas Iscariot<i>,</i> Simon’s <i>son</i>, being one out of the twelve, for* he was about to give him up <i>to the Jews</i>.</p>
<h3>John 7</h3>
<p>{Mk 7:1-23 &amp; Mt 15:1-20 &amp; Jn 
7:1 Galilee, probably Capernaum Spring 29 AD.}</p>
<p>7:1 And after these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee; for* he was not wishing to walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.</p>
<br>
<p>{Jn 7:2-9; Galilee, probably Capernaum.}</p>
<p>7:2 Now the feast of the Jews, <i>that is,</i> the Feast of Tabernacles, was near. 
7:3 Therefore his brethren said to him, Proceed from here and go into Judea, that* your disciples may also view your works which you are doing 
7:4 for* no one does anything in secret, and <i>he</i> himself seeks to be known publicly. If you are doing these things, manifest yourself to the world. 
7:5 For* even his brethren did not believe in him. 
7:6 Therefore Jesus says to them, <b>My time is not yet here, but your* time is always ready.</b> 
7:7 <b>The world is not able to hate you*, but it hates me, because I am testifying concerning it, that its works are evil.</b> 
7:8 <b>You*, go up to the feast. I do not go up to this feast yet, because my time has not yet been fulfilled.</b></p>
<p>7:9 Now having said these things to them, he remained <i>still</i> in Galilee.</p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 9:51-56 &amp; Jn 7:10; Samaria, Sept: 29 AD.}</p>
<p>7:10 Now as his brethren went up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but like <i>it was</i> in secret.</p>
<br>
<p>{Jn 7:11-10:21; Jerusalem, Oct. 29 AD; no parallel.}</p>
<p>7:11 Therefore the Jews were seeking him at the feast and were saying, Where is that <i>man</i>? 
7:12 And there was much murmuring among the crowds concerning him. Some were saying, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he misleads the crowd. 
7:13 Nevertheless no one was publicly speaking concerning him because of fear of the Jews.</p>
<br>
<p>7:14 But when* it was already the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and was teaching. 
7:15 And the Jews were marveling, saying, How does this one know <i>the</i> Scriptures, having not learned <i>them</i>?</p>
<p>7:16 Therefore Jesus answered them and said, <b>My teaching is not mine, but from he who sent me.</b> 
7:17 <b>If anyone is willing to practice his will, he will know concerning the teaching, of what sort <i>it is</i>, from God or I speak from myself.</b> 
7:18 <b>He who speaks from himself is seeking his own glory, but he who is seeking the glory of him who sent him, this one is true and no unrighteousness is in him.</b> 
7:19 <b>Has Moses not given you* the law and <i>yet</i> none out of you* are practicing the law? Why do you* seek to kill me?</b></p>
<p>7:20 The crowd answered and said, You have a demon. Who seeks to kill you?</p>
<p>7:21 Jesus answered and said to them, <b>I did one work and you* all marvel.</b> 
7:22 <b>Because of this, Moses has given you* circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you* circumcise a man.</b> 
7:23 <b>If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that* the Law of Moses may not be torn-down. Are you* bitterly-angry with me, because I made* a man entirely healthy on the Sabbath?</b> 
7:24 <b>Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</b></p>
<br>
<p>7:25 Therefore some out of those from Jerusalem said, Is this not the one whom they are seeking to kill? 
7:26 And behold, he speaks publicly and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers truly know that this is truly the Christ? 
7:27 But we know where this one is from, but whenever the Christ comes, no one knows where he is from.</p>
<p>7:28 Therefore Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, <b>You* both know me and know where I am from, and I have not come from myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you* do not know.</b> 
7:29 <b>I know him, because I am from him and he sent me.</b> 
7:30 Therefore they were seeking to arrest him and <i>yet</i> no one put his hand upon him (because his hour had not come yet).</p>
<p>7:31 But many out of the crowd believed in him, and they were saying, Whenever the Christ comes, he will not do signs more-than those which this one has done, will he? 
7:32 The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning him, and the Pharisees and the high-priests sent attendants that* they might arrest him.</p>
<p>7:33 Therefore Jesus said, <b>I am still with you* <i>for</i> a little time and I go to him who sent me.</b> 
7:34 <b>You* will seek me and will not find <i>me</i> and where I am, you* are not able to come.</b></p>
<p>7:35 Therefore the Jews said with themselves, Where is this one about to travel that we will not find him? He is not about to travel to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, is he? 
7:36 What is this word that he said, You* will seek me and will not find <i>me</i>, and where I am, you* are not able to come?</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>7:37 Now on the last day, the great <i>day</i> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, <b>If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and let him drink.</b> 
7:38 <b>He who believes in me, like the Scripture has said, Rivers of living water will flow out of his belly.</b> {Jn 4:14} 
7:39 But he spoke this concerning the Spirit, which those who believed in him were about to receive; for* the Holy Spirit was not yet <i>given</i>, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</p>
<p>7:40 Therefore many out of the crowd, having heard the word, said, This is truly the prophet.</p>
<p>7:41 Others were saying, This is the Christ. Others were saying, The Christ does not come out of Galilee, does he? 
7:42 Did the Scripture not say that the Christ comes out of the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was? {2Sam. 7:12, Mic. 5:2} 
7:43 So there became a split in the crowd because of him. 
7:44 But some out of them were wishing to arrest him, but no one put hands upon him.</p>
<p>7:45 Therefore, the attendants came to the high-priests and Pharisees, and those <i>men</i> said to them, Why did you* not bring* him?</p>
<p>7:46 The attendants answered, A man has never* spoke <i>like</i> so, like this man.</p>
<p>7:47 Therefore the Pharisees answered them, You* have not also been misled, have you? 
7:48 Not anyone from the rulers or from the Pharisees believed in him, have they? 
7:49 But this crowd that does not know the law are cursed.</p>
<p>7:50 Nicodemus says to them (he who came to him by night, being one out of them), 
7:51 Our law does not judge a man, if it does not hear from him beforehand and may know what he is doing, does it?</p>
<p>7:52 They answered and said to him, You are not also from Galilee, are you? Search and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.</p>
<br>
<p>7:53 And they each traveled to his own house, <h3>John 8</h3> 
8:1 however Jesus traveled to the Mountain of Olives.</p>
<p>8:2 Now <i>at</i> daybreak, he came again into the temple and all the people were coming to him, and he sat down and was teaching them.</p>
<p>8:3 Now the scribes and the Pharisees lead a woman having been overtaken in adultery, and having stood her in the middle <i>of them</i>, 
8:4 they say to him, testing <i>him</i>, Teacher, this woman was overtaken in the very-act of committing adultery. 
8:5 Now Moses commanded us in the law to stone such <i>people</i>. Then* what do you say of her? 
8:6 But they were saying this, testing him, that* they may have <i>something</i> to accuse him.</p>
<p>But Jesus stooped downward and with <i>his</i> finger was writing in the soil and making-like nothing <i>was happening</i>. 
8:7 Now as they were remaining; asking him, he stood-erect and said to them, <b>He who is sinless among you*, let him cast a stone at her first.</b> 
8:8 And again he stooped downward and was writing on the soil.</p>
<p>8:9 Now when* they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, they were going out one by one, beginning from the elders to the last one and Jesus and the woman was left alone, being in his midst.</p>
<p>8:10 Now Jesus stood-erect and said to her, <b>Where are those <i>men</i>, your accusers? Did no one condemn you?</b></p>
<p>8:11 Now she said, No one, Lord.</p>
<p>Now Jesus said, <b>Neither do I judge you. Go-onward. Sin no longer.</b></p>
<br>
<p>8:12 Therefore, again Jesus spoke to them, saying, <b>I am the light of the world. He who is following me may never* walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.</b></p>
<p>8:13 Therefore the Pharisees said to him, You are testifying concerning yourself; your testimony is not true.</p>
<p>8:14 Jesus answered and said to them, <b>Even if I testify concerning myself, my testimony is true, because I know from where I come and where I am going, but you* do not know from where I come or where I am going.</b> 
8:15 <b>You* judge according to the flesh; I judge no one <i>according to the flesh</i>.</b> 
8:16 <b>And <i>yet</i> if I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.</b> 
8:17 <b>And in your* law it has been written, that the testimony of two men is true.</b>  {Deu 19:15} 
8:18 <b>I am he who is testifying concerning myself and the Father who sent me is testifying concerning me.</b></p>
<p>8:19 Therefore they were saying to him, Where is your Father?</p>
<p>Jesus answered, <b>You* know neither me, nor my Father; if you* knew me, you* would also know my Father.</b> 
8:20 (Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, <i>while</i> teaching in the temple and no one arrested him, because his hour had not come yet.)</p>
<p>8:21 Therefore Jesus said again to them, <b>I go away and you* will seek me and will die in your* sin; where I go, you* are not able to come.</b></p>
<p>8:22 Therefore the Jews were saying, Will he kill himself, because he says, Where I go, you* are not able to come?</p>
<p>8:23 And he said to them, <b>You* are from below; I am from above. You* are from this world; I am not from this world.</b> 
8:24 <b>Therefore I said to you*, that you* will die in your* sins; for* if you* do not believe that I am <i>he</i>, you* will die in your* sins.</b></p>
<p>8:25 Therefore they were saying to him, Who are you?</p>
<p>And Jesus said to them, <b>The beginning, something <i>that</i> I am also speaking to you*.</b> 
8:26 <b>I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you*, but he who sent me is true, and the things which I heard from him, I speak these to the world.</b> 
8:27 (They did not know that he spoke <i>concerning</i> the Father to them.) 
8:28 Therefore Jesus said to them, <b>Whenever you* have exalted the Son of Man, then you* will know that I am <i>he</i> and <i>that</i> I am doing nothing from myself, but just-as my Father taught me, I speak these things.</b> 
8:29 <b>And he who sent me is with me; the Father has not left me alone, because I am always doing <i>those</i> things pleasing to him.</b> 
8:30 <i>While</i> speaking these things, many believed in him.</p>
<br>
<p>8:31 Therefore Jesus said to those Jews who have believed him, <b>If you* abide in my word, <i>then</i> you* truly are my disciples;</b> 
8:32 <b>and you* will know the truth and the truth will make you* free.</b> 
8:33 They answered him,   We are Abraham’s seed and have been enslaved to no one at anytime. How do you say, You* will become free?</p>
<p>8:34 Jesus answered them, <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, Everyone who practices sin is the bondservant of sin.</b></p>
<p>8:35 <b>Now the bondservant does not abide in the house forever; the son abides forever.</b> 
8:36 <b>Therefore, if the Son makes you* free, you* will really be free.</b> 
8:37 <b>I know that you* are Abraham’s seed; yet you* are seeking to kill me, because my word is not making room in you*.</b> 
8:38 <b>I speak the things which I have seen with my Father and therefore you* are practicing what you* have seen with your* father.</b></p>
<p>8:39 They answered and said to him, Our father is Abraham.</p>
<p>Jesus says to them, <b>If you* were Abraham’s children, you* <i>would be</i></b> {Greek: were} <b>doing the works of Abraham.</b> 
8:40 <b>But now you* are seeking to kill me, a man who has spoken the truth to you*, which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.</b> 
8:41 <b>You* are practicing the works of your* father.</b></p>
<p>Therefore they said to him, We have not been born from fornication; we have one Father– God.</p>
<p>8:42 Therefore Jesus said to them, <b>If God was your* Father, you* would love* me; for* I came out and <i>have</i> come from God; for* neither have I come from myself, but <i>from</i> that one who sent me.</b> 
8:43 <b>Why do you* not know my speech? <i>Is it</i> because you* are not able to hear my word?</b> 
8:44 <b>You* are from <i>your</i>* father, the Devil, and it is your* will to do the lusts of your* father. That <i>one</i> was a murderer from the beginning and is not standing in the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own, because he is a liar and the father of it.</b> 
8:45 <b>But because I speak the truth, you* do not believe me.</b> 
8:46 <b>Which out of you* convicts me concerning sin? But if I speak <i>the</i> truth, why do you* not believe me?</b>  
8:47 <b>He who is from God hears the declarations of God<i>, but</i> because of this, you* do not hear <i>them</i>, because you* are not from God.</b></p>
<p>8:48 Therefore the Jews answered and said to him, Do we not say well that you are a Samaritan and you have a demon?</p>
<p>8:49 Jesus answered, <b>I do not have a demon, but I am honoring my Father and you* are dishonoring me.</b> 
8:50  <b>But I am not seeking my own glory. There is one who is seeking and is judging.</b> 
8:51 <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, If anyone keeps my word, he may never* view <i>his</i> death.</b></p>
<p>8:52 The Jews said to him, Now we have known that you have a demon. Abraham died and the prophets, and you say, If anyone keeps my word, he may never* taste of death. 
8:53 You are not greater <i>than</i> our father Abraham, who died, are you? And the prophets died; whom are you making* yourself <i>out to be</i>?</p>
<p>8:54 Jesus answered, <b>If I am glorifying myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who is glorifying me; of whom you* say, that he is our God.</b> 
8:55 <b>And you* have not known him, but I know him, and if I say, I do not know him, I will be similar to you*, a liar, but I know him and I am keeping his word.</b> 
8:56 <b>Your* father Abraham was glad that* he might see my day, and he saw it and rejoiced</b>.</p>
<p>8:57 Therefore the Jews said to him, You are not yet fifty years old and you have seen Abraham?</p>
<p>8:58 Jesus said to them, <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, Before Abraham was born, I am.</b> 
8:59 Therefore, they took up stones that* they might cast <i>them</i> at him, but Jesus hid <i>himself</i> and went out of the temple, going through the middle of them and so was passing <i>on</i> by.</p>
<h3>John 9</h3>
<p>9:1 And passing by, he saw a man blind from his birth. 
9:2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this one or his parents, that* he should be born blind?</p>
<p>9:3 Jesus answered, <b>Neither did this one sin, nor his parents, but that* the works of God should be manifest in him.</b> 
9:4 <b>It is essential <i>for</i> me to work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one is able to work.</b> 
9:5 <b>Whenever I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</b> 
9:6 Having said these things, he spits on <i>the</i> level-ground and made* clay from the spit and anointed the clay on the eyes of the blind <i>man</i>, 
9:7 and said to him, <b>Go, wash in the pool of Siloam</b>  (which is by translation, Sent). Therefore, he went away and washed and came <i>back</i> seeing.</p>
<p>9:8 Therefore the neighbors and those viewing him beforehand, that he was blind, were saying, Is this not the one sitting and begging <i>earlier</i>? 
9:9 Others were saying, It is he. But others said, He is similar to him.</p>
<p>That <i>man</i> said, I am <i>he.</i></p>
<p>9:10 Therefore they were saying to him, How were your eyes opened?</p>
<p>9:11 That <i>man</i> answered and said, A man called* Jesus made* clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, <b>Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.</b> And I went away and washed and I recovered <i>my</i> sight.</p>
<br>
<p>9:12 Therefore they said to him, Where is that <i>man</i>?</p>
<p>He says, I do not know.</p>
<p>9:13 They lead him to the Pharisees, <i>he</i> who was previously blind. 
9:14 Now it was <i>the</i> Sabbath on the day when Jesus made* the clay and opened his eyes. 
9:15 Therefore, again the Pharisees were also asking him how he recovered his sight.</p>
<p>Now he said to them, He placed clay upon my eyes and I washed and I <i>can</i> see.</p>
<p>9:16 Therefore, some out of the Pharisees were saying, This man is not from God, because he is not keeping the Sabbath.</p>
<p>Others said, How is a man, a sinner, able to do such signs? But there was a split among them. 
9:17 They say to the blind man again, What do you say concerning him, in that he opened your eyes?</p>
<p>Now he said, He is a prophet.</p>
<p>9:18 Therefore the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he was blind and had recovered his sight, until they summoned the parents of him who had recovered his sight, 
9:19 and asked them, saying, Is this your* son, who you* say was born blind? Then* how does he see now?</p>
<p>9:20 But his parents answered and said, We know that this is our son and that he was born blind; 
9:21 but how he <i>can</i> now see, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. He has <i>come</i> of age*; ask him; he will speak concerning himself. 
9:22 His parents said these things, because they feared the Jews; for* the Jews, themselves, had covenanted already, that* if anyone confesses him <i>as</i> Christ, he should become expelled from the synagogue. 
9:23 Because of this, his parents said, He has <i>come</i> of age*; ask him.</p>
<p>9:24 So they summoned the man who was blind a second-time and said to him, Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.</p>
<p>9:25 Therefore that <i>man</i> answered and said, I do not know if he is a sinner. I know one thing, that I was blind, <i>but</i> now I <i>can</i> see.</p>
<p>9:26 But they said to him again, What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?</p>
<p>9:27 He answered them, I told you* already and you* did not hear; why are you* wishing to hear it again? Do you* wish also to become his disciples?</p>
<p>9:28 They reviled him and said, You are a disciple of that <i>man</i>, but we are disciples of Moses. 
9:29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but this one, we do not know where he is from.</p>
<p>9:30 The man answered and said to them, For* a marvelous thing is in this, because you* do not know where he is from and <i>yet</i> he opened my eyes. 
9:31 But we know that God does not hear sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and <i>if</i> he is practicing his will, he hears him. 
9:32 It has not <i>been</i> heard from the <i>beginning of the</i> world, that anyone <i>has</i> opened the eyes of a man who has been born blind. 
9:33 If this one was not from God, he <i>would</i> be unable to do anything.</p>
<p>9:34 They answered and said to him, You were born entirely in sins and you are teaching us! And they cast him outside.</p>
<p>9:35 Jesus heard that they had cast him outside, and finding him, he said to him, <b>Do you believe in the Son of God?</b></p>
<p>9:36 That <i>man</i> answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that* I should believe in him?</p>
<p>9:37 Now Jesus said to him, <b>You have both seen him and he who speaks with you is that <i>man</i>.</b></p>
<p>9:38 But he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshiped him.</p>
<p>9:39 And Jesus said, <b>I came into this world *for judgment, that* those who do not see, may see, and those who see, may become blind.</b></p>
<p>9:40 And those who were with him from the Pharisees heard these things and said to him, We are not also blind, are we?</p>
<p>9:41 Jesus said to them, <b>If you* were blind, you* would have no sin, but now you* say, We see, therefore your* sin remains.</b></p>
<h3>John 10</h3>
<p>10:1 <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, He who does not enter in through the door into the sheep’s pen, but goes up elsewhere, that <i>man</i> is a thief and a robber.</b> 
10:2 <b>But he who enters in through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</b> 
10:3 <b>The doorkeeper opens to him, and the sheep hear his voice and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</b> 
10:4 <b>And whenever he has cast out his own sheep, he travels before them and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.</b> 
10:5 <b>But they may never* follow another man, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of others.</b> 
10:6 (Jesus was speaking this metaphor to them, but those <i>men</i> did not know what it was that he was speaking to them.)</p>
<br>
<p>10:7 Therefore Jesus said to them again, <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, I am the door of the sheep.</b> 
10:8 <b>All things, as many things as came <i>before</i> are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.</b> 
10:9 <b>I am the door; if anyone enters through me, he will be saved and will enter and will go out and will find pasture.</b> 
10:10 <b>The thief does not come, except that* he may steal, and may sacrifice and may destroy <i>you</i>. I came that* they may have life and may have even-more <i>of it</i>.</b> 
10:11 <b>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life on behalf of the sheep.</b> 
10:12 <b>But the hired <i>servant</i> and not <i>the</i> shepherd, whose sheep are not his own, views the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees and the wolf seizes them and scatters the sheep.</b> 
10:13 <b>Now the hired <i>servant</i> flees because he is a hired <i>servant</i> and he himself does not care concerning the sheep.</b> 
10:14 <b>I am the good shepherd, and I know my own and my own know me,</b>  
10:15 <b>just-as the Father knows me and I know the Father, and I lay <i>down</i> my life on behalf of the sheep.</b> 
10:16 <b>And I have other sheep, which are not of this pen; those also it is essential for me to lead and they will hear my voice and there will become one flock, one shepherd.</b> 
10:17 <b>Because of this, the Father loves* me, because I lay down my life, that* I may take it again.</b> 
10:18 <b>No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down out of myself. I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it <i>up</i> again. I received this commandment from my Father.</b></p>
<p>10:19 Therefore, there became a split again among the Jews because of these words. 
10:20 And many out of them were saying, He has a demon and is mad; why do you* listen <i>to</i> him?</p>
<p>10:21 Others were saying, These are not the words of one <i>who is</i> demon-possessed. A demon is not able to open the eyes of the blind, is it?</p>

<p>{Jn 10:22-42; Jerusalem and beyond Jordan; no parallel.}</p>
<p>10:22 Now it happened <i>to be</i> Hanukkah in Jerusalem and it was winter, 
10:23 and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s porch. 
10:24 Therefore the Jews surrounded him and were saying to him, Until when, <i>will</i> you take <i>before telling us</i> if you are the Christ? Tell us frankly.</p>
<p>10:25 Jesus answered them, <b>I told you* and you* do not believe. The works that I am doing in my Father’s name, these are testifying concerning me.</b> 
10:26 <b>But you* do not believe, for* you* are not from my sheep just-as I said to you*.</b> 
10:27 <b>My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me,</b> 
10:28 <b>and I give to them everlasting life, and they may never* perish and not anyone will take them out of my hand.</b> 
10:29 <b>My Father, who has given <i>them</i> to me, he is greater <i>than</i> all, and no one is able to take <i>them</i> out of my Father’s hand.</b> 
10:30 <b>I and the Father are one.</b> 
10:31 Therefore the Jews bore stones again that* they might stone him. 
10:32 Jesus answered them, <b>I have showed you* many good works from my Father, because of what work from those do you* stone me?</b></p>
<p>10:33 The Jews answered him, saying, We do not stone you concerning a good work, but concerning blasphemy, and because you being a man, are making* yourself God.</p>
<p>10:34 Jesus answered them, <b>Is it not written in your* law, <i>that</i> I said, You* are gods?</b> {Ps 82:6?} 
10:35 <b>If he called those <i>men</i> gods, to whom the word of God came* (and the Scripture is not able to be torn-down),</b> 
10:36 <b>do you* say of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, You blaspheme, because I said, I am <i>the</i> Son of God?</b> 
10:37 <b>If I am not doing the works of my Father, <i>then</i> do not believe me.</b> 
10:38 <b>But if I am doing them, even if you* do not believe me, believe the works; that* you* may know and may believe that the Father is in me and I in him.</b> 
10:39 Therefore they were seeking again to arrest him and he went forth out of their hand.</p>
<br>
<p>10:40 And he went away again beyond-that <i>area</i> of the Jordan into the place where John was first immersing*, and he remained there. 
10:41 And many came to him and they were saying, John indeed did no sign, but all things, as many things as John spoke concerning this one were true. 
10:42 And many believed in him there.</p>
<h3>John 11</h3>
<p>{Jn 11:1-46; Peraea to Bethany, Jan. 30 AD; no parallel.}</p>
<p>11:1 Now a certain <i>man</i> was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, from the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 
11:2 Now it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. 
11:3 Therefore the sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick.</p>
<p>11:4 But when* Jesus heard it, he said, <b>This sickness is not to death, but on behalf of the glory of God, that* the Son of God may be glorified through it.</b> 
11:5 Now Jesus loved* Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 
11:6 Therefore, as he heard that he was sick, then indeed, he remained in the place <i>where he was for</i> two days. 
11:7 Thereafter, after this <i>time</i>, he says to the disciples, <b>We should go into Judea again.</b></p>
<p>11:8 The disciples say to him, Rabbi, the Jews <i>just</i> now were seeking to stone you, and you are going <i>back</i> there again?</p>
<p>11:9 Jesus answered, <b>Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</b> 
11:10 <b>But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.</b> 
11:11 He spoke these things and he says to them after this, <b>Our friend Lazarus has fallen-asleep, but I am traveling, that* I may wake him.</b></p>
<p>11:12 Therefore the disciples said to him, Lord, if he has fallen-asleep, he will be cured.</p>
<p>11:13 (Now Jesus had spoken concerning his death, but those <i>men</i> thought that he spoke concerning the restfulness of sleep.) 
11:14 Then*, Jesus said to them frankly then, <b>Lazarus is dead.</b> 
11:15 <b>And I rejoice because of you* that I myself was not there, in order that* you* may believe, but we should go to him.</b></p>
<p>11:16 Therefore Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, We should also go, that* we may die with him.</p>
<br>
<p>11:17 Therefore, when* Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb <i>for</i> four days already. 
11:18 Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, approximately fifteen furlongs off; 
11:19 and many from the Jews had come to those around Martha and Mary, that* they may console them concerning their brother. 
11:20 Therefore Martha, as she heard that Jesus is coming, met him, but Mary was still sitting in the house. 
11:21 Therefore Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you were here, my brother would have not died. 
11:22 But even now I know that, as many things as you may ask <i>of</i> God, God will give you.</p>
<p>11:23 Jesus says to her, <b>Your brother will rise* up <i>again</i>.</b></p>
<p>11:24 Martha says to him, I know that he will rise* up in the resurrection at the last day.</p>
<p>11:25 Jesus said to her, <b>I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, even if he dies, he will live;</b>  
11:26 <b>and everyone who lives and believes in me may never* die– forever. Do you believe this?</b></p>
<p>11:27 She says to him, Yes, Lord. I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, he who comes into the world. 
11:28 And having said these things, she went away and secretly summoned Mary her sister, saying, The Teacher is here and is summoning you. 
11:29 As that <i>woman</i> heard it, she arose quickly and comes to him. 
11:30 (Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.)</p>
<p>11:31 Therefore the Jews who were with her in the house and were consoling her, when* they saw Mary, that she stood up quickly and went out, they followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb that* she may weep there.</p>
<p>11:32 Therefore Mary, as she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell down <i>next</i> to his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you had been there*, my brother would have not died.</p>
<p>11:33 Therefore, as Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews <i>also</i> weeping who came together with her, he sighed in <i>his</i> spirit and was disturbed, 
11:34 and said, <b>Where have you* laid him?</b></p>
<p>They say to him, Lord, come and see.</p>
<p>11:35 Jesus shed-tears.</p>
<p>11:36 Therefore the Jews were saying, Behold how he loved him!</p>
<p>11:37 But some out of them said, Was this one, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, not able to also do <i>something</i> in order that this one might not have died?</p>
<p>11:38 Therefore Jesus again, sighing in himself, comes to the tomb. Now it was a cave and a stone was laying against it. 
11:39 Jesus says, <b>Lift up the stone</b>.</p>
<p>Martha, the sister of him who has died, says to him, Lord, already <i>the body</i> stinks <i>from decay</i>; for* it is four days <i>old</i>.</p>
<p>11:40 Jesus says to her, <b>Did I not say to you, that, if you believed, you will see the glory of God?</b> 
11:41 So they took away the stone where the dead was laid. Now Jesus lifted his eyes upward and said, <b>Father, I give-thanks to you that you heard me.</b> 
11:42 <b>Now I knew that you always hear me, but because of the crowd who is standing around I said it, that* they may believe that you did send me.</b> 
11:43 And having said these things, he cried-out with a loud voice, <b>Lazarus, come-here! <i>Come</i> outside!</b> 
11:44 And he who had died came out, having been bound hand and foot with burial wrappings, and his vision had been bound around with a handkerchief. Jesus says to them, <b>Loose him and allow <i>him</i> to go</b>.</p>
<p>11:45 Therefore many out of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him. 
11:46 But some out of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.</p>
<br>
<p>{Jn 11:47-54; Jerusalem and Ephraim in Judea; no parallel.}</p>
<p>11:47 Therefore, the high-priests and the Pharisees gathered together a council and were saying, What are we doing because this one is doing many signs? 
11:48 If we allow him <i>to continue</i> so; all men will believe in him. And the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.</p>
<p>11:49 But a certain <i>man</i> out of them, Caiaphas, being <i>the</i> high-priest of that year, said to them, You* know nothing, 
11:50 nor do you* reason that it is advantageous for us that* one man should die on behalf of the people and not <i>that*</i> the whole nation should perish. 
11:51 (Now he said this not from himself, but being high-priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die on behalf of the nation; 
11:52 and not only on behalf of the nation, but that* he should also gather together into one the children of God who have been scattered.) 
11:53 So from that day forth, they counseled together that* they might kill him.</p>
<br>
<p>11:54 Therefore, Jesus was not walking publicly anymore among the Jews, but went away <i>from</i> there into the region near to the wilderness, into a city called* Ephraim, and he was staying there with his disciples.</p>
<br>
<p>{Jn 11:55-12:1, 9-11 Bethany March 31- April 1, 30 AD; no parallel.}</p>
<p>11:55 Now the Passover of the Jews was near and many went up to Jerusalem out of the region before the Passover, that* they might purify themselves. 
11:56 Therefore, they were seeking Jesus and were speaking with one another <i>while</i> standing in the temple, What are you* thinking? <i>That</i> he may never* come to the feast. 
11:57 Now both the high-priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that*, if anyone knows where he was, he should divulge <i>it</i>, *that they might arrest him.</p>
<h3>John 12</h3>
<p>{The week of Jesus’ crucifixion. Mk 11:1-11 &amp; Mt 21:1-12, 14-17 &amp; Lk 19:29-44 &amp; Jn 12:12-19 Bethany to Jerusalem and back Sun. April 2, 30 AD.}</p>
<p>12:1 Therefore, Jesus came to Bethany six days before the Passover, where Lazarus was, who had died, whom he raised from the dead.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>{Mk 14:10-11 &amp; Mt 26:14-16 &amp; Lk 22:3-6 &amp; Jn 12:2-8.}</p>
<p>12:2 So they made* him a supper there and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of those who reclined <i>at the meal</i> together with him. 
12:3 Therefore, Mary took a pound of perfume of precious undiluted nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled from the aroma of the perfume. 
12:4 Therefore Judas Iscariot, Simon’s <i>son</i>, one out of his disciples, who is about to give him up, says, 
12:5 Why was this perfume not sold* for three hundred denarii and given to the poor? 
12:6 Now this he said, not because he was caring concerning the poor, but because he was a thief and had the box and was bearing what was put <i>in it</i>.</p>
<p>12:7 Therefore Jesus said, <b>Allow her, she has kept it *for the day of my burying.</b> 
12:8 <b>For* the poor you* always have with you*, but you* do not always have me</b>.</p>
<br>
<p>12:9 Therefore, a crowd out of the Jews knew that he was there and they came, not only because of Jesus, but that* they might also see Lazarus, whom he <i>had</i> raised from the dead. 
12:10 But the high-priests counseled that* they might also kill Lazarus; 
12:11 that because of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>12:12 A large crowd came to the feast on the next-day, having heard that Jesus is coming into Jerusalem, 
12:13 <i>and</i> they took the limbs of the palm trees and went forth to a meeting with him and was crying out, Hosanna. He who is coming in the name of the Lord has been blessed, the King of Israel.</p>
<p>12:14 Now Jesus, having found a young-donkey, sat upon it; as it is written, 
12:15 ‘Do not fear, daughter of Zion. Behold, your King is coming, sitting upon a donkey’s colt.’ {Isa 40:9, 62:11, Zech. 9:9} 
12:16 (But his disciples did not know these things <i>at</i> first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written on <i>the basis of</i> him and <i>that</i> they had done these things to him.) 
12:17 Therefore, the crowd that was together with him was witnessing when he summoned Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him <i>up</i> from the dead. 
12:18 Also because of this, the crowd went and met him, because it heard that he had done this sign. 
12:19 Therefore the Pharisees said with themselves, You are viewing that you* profit nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.</p>
<br>
<p>{Jn 12:20-50 In the Temple, Tues.; no parallel.}</p>
<p>12:20 Now there were some Greeks from them coming up that* they might worship at the feast; 
12:21 therefore these came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee and asked him, saying, Lord, we wish to see Jesus. 
12:22 Philip comes and speaks to Andrew, and again Andrew and Philip speak to Jesus.</p>
<p>12:23 But Jesus answered them, saying, <b>The hour has come, that* the Son of Man should be glorified.</b> 
12:24 <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, If a kernel of grain does not fall into the soil and die, it abides alone by itself, but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.</b> 
12:25 <b>He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it to everlasting life.</b> 
12:26 <b>If anyone serves me, let him follow me, and where I am, my servant will also be there. And if anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.</b> 
12:27 <b>Now my soul has been disturbed, and what should I say? Father, save me from this hour? But I came to this hour because of this.</b> 
12:28 <b>Father, glorify your name</b>.</p>
<p>Therefore, a voice came from heaven, <i>saying</i>, <b>I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.</b></p>
<p>12:29 Therefore, the crowd standing <i>there</i> and heard it, was saying, Thunder has come*.</p>
<p>Others said, A messenger has spoken to him.</p>
<p>12:30 Jesus answered and said, <b>This voice has not come* because of me, but because of you*.</b> 
12:31 <b>Now is the judgment of this world. Now the ruler of this world will be cast outside.</b> 
12:32 <b>And if I am exalted out of the earth, I will attract all <i>peoples</i> to myself.</b> 
12:33 But he said this, signifying by what <i>sort of</i> death he was about to die.</p>
<p>12:34 The crowd answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever and how do you say, It is essential <i>for</i> the Son of Man to be exalted? Who is this Son of Man?</p>
<p>12:35 Therefore Jesus said to them, <b>The light is still with you* <i>for</i> a little time. Walk while you* have the light, that* darkness might not overtake you* and he who is walking in the darkness does not know where he is going.</b> 
12:36 <b>While you* have the light, believe in the light, that* you* might become sons of light.</b></p>
<br>
<p>Jesus spoke these things and he went away and hid <i>himself</i> from them. 
12:37 But <i>though</i> he had done so-many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him, 
12:38 in order that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, ‘Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?’ {Isa 53:1} 
12:39 Because of this, they were not able to believe, because Isaiah said again, 
12:40 ‘He has blinded their eyes and he has hardened their heart; that* they should not see with their eyes and should perceive with their heart and should turn and <i>that*</i> I might heal them.’{Isa 6:9, 10} 
12:41 Isaiah said these things, when he saw his glory, and he spoke concerning him. 
12:42 Nevertheless even many out of the rulers also believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing <i>it</i>, that* they might not become expelled from the synagogue; 
12:43 for* they loved* the glory from men rather than the glory from God.</p>
<br>
<p>12:44 Now Jesus cried and said, <b>He who believes in me, does not believe in me, but in him who sent me.</b> 
12:45  <b>And he who views me views him who sent me.</b> 
12:46 <b>I have come <i>like</i> a light into the world, that* everyone who believes in me may not remain in the darkness.</b> 
12:47 <b>And if anyone hears and does not believe my declarations, I do not judge him; for* I did not come in order that I may judge the world, but in order that I may save the world.</b> 
12:48 <b>He who is rejecting me and is not receiving my declarations, has that which judges him; the word that I spoke that will judge him in the last day.</b> 
12:49 <b>Because I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say and what I should speak.</b> 
12:50 <b>And I know that his commandment is everlasting life, because the things which I speak, just-as the Father has said to me, so I speak <i>to you</i>.</b></p>
<h3>John 13</h3>
<p>{Jn 13:1-20 Thurs. Evening; no parallel.}</p>
<p>13:1 Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that his hour has come that* he should proceed out of this world to his Father, having loved* his own that were in the world, he loved* them to the end. 
13:2 And it happened <i>during</i> supper, the Devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s <i>son</i>, that* he should give him up. 
13:3 Jesus, knowing that the Father has given all the things into his hands and that he came forth from God and is going to God, 
13:4 arose from supper and places aside his garments, and he took a towel and girded himself. 
13:5 Thereafter he puts water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe <i>them</i> with the towel in which he was girded.</p>
<p>13:6 Therefore, he comes to Simon Peter and that <i>man</i> says to him, Lord, <i>why</i> are you washing my feet?</p>
<p>13:7 Jesus answered and said to him, <b>What I do you do not know now, but you will know after this.</b></p>
<p>13:8 Peter says to him, Never* wash my feet.</p>
<p>Jesus answered him, <b>If I do not wash you, you have no part with me.</b></p>
<p>13:9 Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.</p>
<p>13:10 Jesus says to him, <b>He who has been bathed does not need to wash, <i>other</i> than the feet, but is entirely clean and you* are clean, but not all.</b> 
13:11 (For* he knew him who is giving him up.) Because of this, he said, <b>You* are not all clean.</b></p>
<br>
<p>13:12 Therefore, when he <i>had</i> washed their feet and <i>had</i> taken <i>up</i> his garments, having leaned-back again, he said to them, <b>You* know what I have done for you*?</b> 
13:13  <b>You* address me as the Teacher and, Lord, and you* say well; for* so I am.</b> 
13:14 <b>Therefore, if I, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your* feet, you* also ought to wash one another’s feet.</b> 
13:15 <b>For* I gave you* an example, that* you* also should do like I have done for you*.</b> 
13:16 <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, A bondservant is not greater <i>than</i> his lord; nor <i>is</i> an apostle greater <i>than</i> he who sent him.</b> 
13:17 <b>If you* know these things, you* are fortunate if you* do them.</b></p>
<p>13:18 <b>I do not speak concerning all of you*. I know whom I have chosen, but in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, ‘He who eats bread with me, lifted up his heel against me.’</b> {Psa 41:9} 
13:19 <b>From now on I tell you* before it <i>is</i> to happen, that*, whenever it has happened, you* may believe that I am <i>he.</i></b> 
13:20  <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, He who receives anyone, whomever I send, receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 26:21-25, 26:31-35 &amp; Mk 14:18-21, 14:27-31 &amp; Lk 22:21-23, 22:31-38 &amp; Jn 13:21-38.}</p>
<p>13:21 Jesus having said these things, was disturbed in the spirit and testified and said, <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, that one out of you* will give me up.</b></p>
<p>13:22 Therefore the disciples were looking toward one another, being perplexed concerning whom he is talking <i>about</i>. 
13:23 But one of his disciples was reclining on Jesus’ bosom, <i>the one</i> whom Jesus loved*. 
13:24 Therefore, Simon Peter signals to him to inquire, who it might be, concerning whom he is talking <i>about</i>. 
13:25 But that <i>man</i> who had leaned upon Jesus’ chest says to him, Lord, who is it?</p>
<p>13:26 Jesus answers, <b>It is that <i>man</i> to whom I have dipped the morsel, and I will give it to him.</b> And having dipped the morsel, he takes <i>it</i> and gives it to Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son. 
13:27 And after the morsel, then the Adversary entered into him. Therefore Jesus says to that <i>man</i>, <b>What you are doing, do quickly.</b> 
13:28 (Now no one of those reclining <i>at the table</i> knew for what <i>purpose</i> he spoke this to him. 
13:29 For* some were thinking, since Judas had the box, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we have need of *for the feast; or, that* he should give something to the poor.) 
13:30 Therefore, having received the morsel, that man went out immediately and it was night.</p>
<br>
<p>13:31 Therefore, when he went out, Jesus says, <b>Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in him;</b>  
13:32 <b>If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and immediately he will glorify him.</b> 
13:33 <b>Little-children, I am still with you* <i>for</i> a little <i>while</i>. You* will seek me and just-as I said to the Jews, Where I am going, you* are not able to come. Also now I am saying to you*,</b> 
13:34 <b>I am giving to you* a new commandment, that* you* should love* one another; just-as I have loved* you*, that* you* also should love* one another.</b> 
13:35 <b>All men will know that you* are my disciples by this, if you* have love* among one another.</b></p>
<p>13:36 Simon Peter says to him, Lord, where are you going?</p>
<p>Jesus answered him, <b>I am going where you are not able to follow now, but you will follow me later.</b></p>
<p>13:37 Peter says to him, Lord, why am I not able to follow you <i>even</i> now? I will lay <i>down</i> my life on your behalf.</p>
<p>13:38 Jesus answered him, <b>Will you lay <i>down</i> your life on my behalf? Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you, The rooster may never* crow, until you have denied me three-times.</b></p>

14:7 <b>If you* had known me, you* would have also known my Father; from now on you* know him and have seen him.</b></p>

<p>14:22 Judas (not Iscariot) says to him, Lord, what has happened that you are about to manifest yourself to us and not to the world?</p>
<p>14:23 Jesus answered and said to him, <b>If anyone loves* me, he will keep my word and my Father will love* him and we will come to him and will make* our abode with him.</b> 
14:24 <b>He who does not love* me, does not keep my words. And the word which you* hear is not mine, but the Father’s, <i>he</i> who sent me.</b></p>
<p>14:25 <b>I have spoken these things to you*, <i>while</i> remaining with you*.</b> 
14:26 <b>But the Helper*, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, that one will teach you* all things and will remind you* of all that I said to you*.</b> 
14:27 <b>I am leaving peace with you*. I am giving my peace to you*; not like the world gives, I am giving to you*. Let your* heart not be disturbed, nor let it be cowardly.</b> 
14:28 <b>You* heard that I said to you*, I am going-onward and I am coming to you*. If you* loved* me, you* would have rejoiced, because I said, I am going-onward to the Father, because the Father is greater <i>than</i> I.</b> 
14:29 <b>And now I have told you* before it <i>is</i> to happen, that*, whenever it has happened, you* may believe.</b> 
14:30 <b>I will still not speak much <i>longer</i> with you*, for* the ruler of the world is coming and he has nothing in me;</b> 
14:31 <b>but that* the world may know that I love* the Father and just-as the Father commanded me, thus I am doing.</b></p>
<p><b>Arise, we should go from here.</b></p>
<h3>John 15</h3>
<p>15:1 <b>I am the true vine and my Father is the farmer.</b>  
15:2 <b>Every branch <i>which is</i> not bringing forth fruit in me, he takes it away and every <i>branch which is</i> bringing forth fruit, he prunes it, in order that it may bring forth more fruit.</b> 
15:3 <b>Already you* are clean because of the word which I have spoken to you*.</b> 
15:4 <b>Abide in me and I in you*. Just-as the branch is not able to bring forth fruit from itself, if it does not abide in the vine; so neither <i>can</i> you* if you* do not abide in me.</b> 
15:5 <b>I am the vine, you* are the branches. He who abides in me and I in him, this one is bringing forth much fruit, because you* are not able to do anything separate from me.</b> 
15:6 <b>If anyone does not abide in me, he is cast outside like a branch and is dried up, and they gather them and cast them into the fire and it is burned.</b> 
15:7 <b>If you* abide in me, and my words should abide in you*, ask whatever you* wish, and it will happen for you*.</b> 
15:8 <b>My Father is glorified in this, that* you* may bring forth much fruit and will become my disciples.</b></p>
<p>15:9 <b>Just-as the Father has loved* me, I have also loved* you*. Abide in my love*.</b> 
15:10 <b>If you* keep my commandments, you* will abide in my love*; just-as I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love*.</b> 
15:11 <b>I have spoken to you* these things, that* my joy may abide in you* and <i>that*</i> your* joy may be fulfilled.</b> 
15:12 <b>This is my commandment, that* you* should love* one another, just-as I have loved* you*.</b> 
15:13 <b>No one has greater love* <i>than</i> this: that* someone should lay <i>down</i> his life on behalf of his friends.</b> 
15:14  <b>You* are my friends, if you* practice as many things as I command you*.</b> 
15:15 <b>I call* you* bondservants no more, because the bondservant has not known what his lord is doing, but I have called you* friends, because all things that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you*.</b> 
15:16 <b>You* did not choose me, but I chose you* and appointed* you*, that* you* should go and should bring forth fruit and <i>that*</i> your* fruit should abide, that* if you* ask anything of the Father in my name, he should give <i>it to</i> you*.</b> 
15:17 <b>I command you* <i>to do</i> these things, that* you* may love* one another.</b></p>
<p>15:18 <b>If the world hates you*, you* know that it has hated me before <i>it hated</i> you*.</b> 
15:19 <b>If you* were of* the world, the world would love its own, but because you* are not of* the world, but I chose you* out of the world, because of this, the world is hating you*.</b> 
15:20  <b>Remember the word that I said to you*, A bondservant is not greater <i>than</i> his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you*; if they kept my word, they will also keep yours*.</b> 
15:21 <b>But they will do all these things to you* because of my name, because they do not know him who sent me.</b> 
15:22 <b>If I had not come and spoken to them, they were having</b>  {i.e. would have. Or: were holding} <b>no sin, but now they have no excuse concerning their sin.</b> 
15:23 <b>He who hates me also hates my Father.</b> 
15:24 <b>If I had not done the works which no other has done among them, <i>then</i> they were having</b> {i.e. would have. Or: were holding} <b>no sin, but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.</b> 
15:25 <b>But <i>this happened</i>, in order that the word might be fulfilled that has been written in their law, ‘They hated me undeservedly.’</b> {Ps 109:3}</p>
<p>15:26 <b>But whenever the Helper* has come, whom I will send to you* from the Father, <i>who is</i> the Spirit of the truth, who goes-onward from the Father, that one will testify concerning me;</b> 
15:27 <b>and you* also testify, because you* have been with me from the beginning.</b></p>
<h3>John 16</h3>
<p>16:1 <b>I have spoken to you* these things, that* you* should not be offended.</b> 
16:2 <b>They will expel you* from the synagogues. But the hour is coming, that* everyone who kills you* may think that he is offering divine service to God.</b> 
16:3 <b>And they will do these things <i>to you</i>*, because they have not known the Father, nor me.</b>  
16:4 <b>But I have spoken these things to you*, that* whenever the hour has come, you* may remember them, that I told <i>them</i> to you*. Now I did not say these things to you* from the beginning, because I was with you*.</b> 
16:5 <b>But now I am going to him who sent me, and none out of you* asks me, Where are you going?</b> 
16:6 <b>But because I have spoken these things to you*, sorrow has filled your* heart.</b> 
16:7 <b>But I tell you* the truth. It is advantageous for you* that* I should go away; for* if I do not go away, the Helper* will not come to you*, but if I go-onward, I will send him to you*.</b> 
16:8 <b>And when* he has come, that one will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment.</b> 
16:9 <b>Concerning sin, indeed, because they did not believe in me;</b> 
16:10 <b>concerning righteousness, because I am going to my Father and you* view me no more;</b> 
16:11 <b>and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.</b> 
16:12 <b>I still have many things to say to you*, but you* are not able to bear them now.</b> 
16:13 <b>But whenever that one, the Spirit of the truth, comes, he will guide you* into all the truth; for* he will not speak from himself, but as many things as he may hear, <i>these</i> he will speak and he will report to you* the things that are to come.</b> 
16:14  <b>He will glorify me, because he will receive out of mine and will report <i>it</i> to you*.</b> 
16:15 <b>All things, as many things as the Father has are mine, because of this, I said, that he is receiving out of mine and will report <i>it</i> to you*.</b> 
16:16 <b>A little <i>while</i> and you* do not view me, and again a little <i>while</i> and you* will see me, because I am going to the Father.</b></p>
<p>16:17 Therefore<i>, some</i> out of his disciples said to one another, What is this that he says to us, A little <i>while</i> and you* do not view me, and again a little <i>while</i> and you* will see me, also, Because I am going to the Father?</p>
<p>16:18 Therefore they were saying, What is this that he says, A little <i>while</i>? We do not know <i>the meaning of</i> what he says.</p>
<p>16:19 Therefore, Jesus knew that they were wishing to ask him <i>the meaning of this,</i> and he said to them, <b>Are you* debating with one another concerning this, that I said, A little <i>while</i> and you* do not view me, and again, A little <i>while</i> and you* will see me?</b> 
16:20 <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, that you* will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice. But you* will be sorrowful, but your* sorrow will happen <i>leading you</i>* to joy.</b> 
16:21 <b>A woman has sorrow whenever she gives-birth, because her hour has come, but whenever the child is born, she remembers the affliction no more, because of the joy that a child has been born into the world.</b> 
16:22 <b>And therefore, you* now indeed have sorrow, but I will see you* again and your* heart will rejoice and no one takes your* joy away from you*.</b> 
16:23 <b>And in that day you* will not be asking me anything. Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you*, that as many things as you* may ask the Father, he will give it to you* in my name.</b> 
16:24 <b>Until now you* have asked nothing in my name. Ask and you* will receive, that* your* joy may be fulfilled.</b></p>
<p>16:25 <b>I have spoken these things to you* in metaphors, but the hour is coming, when I will no more speak to you* in metaphors, but will proclaim to you* frankly concerning the Father.</b> 
16:26 <b>In that day you* will ask in my name and I do not say to you* that I will request <i>of</i> the Father concerning you*;</b> 
16:27 <b>for* the Father himself loves you*, because you* have loved me and have believed that I came forth from God.</b> 
16:28  <b>I came out from the Father and have come into the world, again, I am leaving the world and I am going-onward to the Father.</b></p>
<p>16:29 <i>Then</i> his disciples speak to him, Behold, now you speak frankly and are not speaking <i>in</i> a metaphor. 
16:30 Now we know that you know all things and do not have need that* anyone should ask you. We believe that you came forth from God by this.</p>
<p>16:31 Jesus answered them, <b>Do you* believe now?</b> 
16:32  <b>Behold, the hour is coming and has now come, that* you* might be scattered, each one to his own and you* might leave me alone and <i>yet</i> I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</b> 
16:33 <b>I have spoken to you* these things, that* you* may have peace in me. You* have affliction in the world, but have courage; I have overcome the world.</b></p>
<h3>John 17</h3>
<p>17:1 Jesus spoke these things, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, <b>Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son, that* your Son may also glorify you;</b> 
17:2 <b>just-as you gave him authority over all flesh, that* to all whom you have given him, he will give everlasting life to them.</b> 
17:3 <b>But this is everlasting life, that* they should know you, the only true God, and Jesus <i>the</i> Christ, whom you did send.</b> 
17:4 <b>I glorified you upon the earth. I completed the work which you have given me, that* I should be doing.</b> 
17:5 <b>And now, Father, glorify me with yourself in the glory which I was having with you before the world was.</b> 
17:6 <b>I manifested your name to the men whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours and you have given them to me, and they have kept your word.</b> 
17:7 <b>Now they have known that all things, as many things as you have given me, are from you,</b> 
17:8 <b>because the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received <i>them</i> and do truly know that I came forth from you and they believed that you sent me.</b></p>
<p>17:9 <b>I am requesting concerning them. I am not requesting concerning the world, but concerning those whom you have given to me, because they are yours.</b>  
17:10 <b>And all things that are mine are yours and yours are mine and I have been glorified in them.</b> 
17:11 <b>And I am no more in the world and these are in the world and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name whom you have given me, that* they may be one, just-as we <i>are one.</i></b> 
17:12 <b>When I was with them in the world, I was keeping them in your name whom you have given me. I guarded them and not one out of them perished, except the son of destruction; in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</b> 
17:13 <b>But now I am coming to you, and I speak these things in the world, that* they may have my joy, having been fulfilled in themselves</b>. 
17:14 <b>I have given them your word, and the world hated them, because they are not of* the world, just-as I am not of* the world.</b></p>
<p>17:15 <b>I am not requesting that* you should take them from the world, but that* you should keep them from the evil <i>one</i>.</b> 
17:16 <b>They are not of* the world just-as I am not of* the world.</b> 
17:17 <b>Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.</b> 
17:18 <b>Just-as you did send me into the world, I also sent them into the world.</b> 
17:19 <b>And I sanctify myself on their behalf, that* they themselves may also be sanctified in truth.</b></p>
<p>17:20 <b>I am not requesting concerning these only, but concerning those who also believe in me through their word;</b> 
17:21 <b>that* they may all be one; like you, Father, <i>are</i> in me and I in you, that* they may also be one in us; that* the world may believe that you did send me.</b>  
17:22 <b>And the glory which you have given me I have given to them; that* they may be one, just-as we are one;</b> 
17:23 <b>I in them and you in me, that* they may be completed into one and that* the world may know that you did send me and you loved* them, just-as you loved* me.</b> 
17:24 <b>Father, I wish that* they, whom you have given me, may also be with me where I am, that* they may view my glory, which you gave me, because you loved* me before the conception of the world.</b> 
17:25 <b>O righteous Father, the world did not know you, but I knew you, and these knew that you did send me;</b> 
17:26 <b>and I made known to them your name and will make it known; that* the love* in which you loved* me may be in them and I in them.</b></p>
<h3>John 18</h3>
<p>{Mk 14:26, 14:32-42 &amp; Mt 26:30, 26:36-46 &amp; Lk 22:39-46 &amp; Jn 
18:1 Garden between Stream of Kidron and Mountain of Olives, Late Thurs. night.}</p>
<p>18:1 Jesus, having said these words, went forth together with his disciples beyond-that <i>area</i> of the winter-stream of Kidron <i>valley</i> {Or: of the Cedars}, where there was a garden, into which he himself and his disciples entered.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 14:43-52 &amp; Mt 26:47-56 &amp; Lk 22:47-53 &amp; Jn 18:2-11 Gethsemane, Friday a few hours before dawn.}</p>
<p>18:2 Now Judas, (who is giving him up), also knew the place, because Jesus gathered there often together with his disciples. 
18:3 Therefore, having received the cohort {600 soldiers} and attendants from the high-priests and <i>the</i> Pharisees, Judas comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons. 
18:4 Therefore Jesus, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went forth and says to them, <b>Whom are you* seeking?</b></p>
<p>18:5 They answered him, Jesus the Nazarene.</p>
<p>Jesus says to them, <b>I am <i>he</i>.</b> And Judas, who was giving him up, stood also with them. 
18:6 Therefore, as he said to them, <b>I am <i>he</i>,</b> they went away and fell to <i>the</i> level-ground. 
18:7 Therefore again he asked them, <b>Whom are you* seeking?</b></p>
<p>But they said, Jesus the Nazarene.</p>
<p>18:8 Jesus answered, <b>I told you* that I am <i>he</i>; therefore if you* seek me, allow these <i>men</i> to go away.</b> 
18:9 <i>(This happened</i> in order that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, <b>Out of those whom you have given me, I did not lose one.</b>) 
18:10 Therefore, Simon Peter, having a sword, unsheathed it and struck the high-priest’s bondservant and cut off his right ear. Now the bondservant’s name was Malchus. 
18:11 Therefore Jesus said to Peter, <b>Put your sword into the sheath. The cup which the Father has given me, should I not drink it?</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Jn 18:12-14, 18:19-23 Friday before dawn; no parallel.}</p>
<p>18:12 So the cohort {600 soldiers} and the commander and the attendants of the Jews, took Jesus and bound him, 
18:13 and led him to Annas first; for* he was <i>the</i> father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high-priest that year. 
18:14 But it was Caiaphas, who counseled the Jews that it was advantageous for one man to perish on behalf of the people.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 
14:54 &amp; Mt 
26:58 &amp; Lk 22:54b-62 &amp; Jn 18:15-18 Courtyard of High Priest’s residence, Friday around dawn.}</p>
<p>18:15 Now Simon Peter and the other disciple was following Jesus. Now that disciple was known to the high-priest and went in together with Jesus into the courtyard of the high-priest; 
18:16 but Peter was standing outside at the door. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high-priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and led in Peter.</p>
<p>18:17 Therefore, the maidservant <i>who was</i> the doorkeeper says to Peter, Are you also <i>one</i> out of this man’s disciples?</p>
<p>That <i>man</i> says, I am not.</p>
<p>18:18 Now the bondservants and the attendants were standing <i>there</i>, having made* a coal-fire, because it was cold, and they were warming themselves and Peter was standing and warming himself with them.</p>
<br>
<p>{See Jn 18:12-14 above.}</p>
<p>18:19 Therefore, the high-priest asked Jesus concerning his disciples and concerning his teaching. 
18:20 Jesus answered him, <b>I spoke publicly to the world; I always taught in <i>the</i> synagogue<i>s</i> and in the temple, where the Jews always come together, and I spoke nothing in secret.</b> 
18:21 <b>Why are you asking me? Ask those who have heard <i>me</i>, what I spoke to them. Behold, these know what I said.</b></p>
<p>18:22 Now having said these things, one of the attendants standing beside <i>him</i> gave a slap on the cheek to Jesus, saying, <i>Why</i> are you answering the high-priest so?</p>
<p>18:23 Jesus answered him, <b>If I spoke evilly, testify concerning the evil, but if well, why are you whipping me?</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 
14:53 &amp; Mt 
26:57 &amp; Lk 22:54a &amp; Jn 
18:24 Palace of Caiaphas, before dawn.}</p>
<p>18:24 Annas sent him having been bound to Caiaphas the high-priest.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 14:66-72 &amp; Mt 26:69-75 &amp; Lk 22:55-62 &amp; Jn 18:25-27.}</p>
<p>18:25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Therefore they said to him, Are you also <i>one</i> out of his disciples?</p>
<p>Then* that <i>man</i> denied and said, I am not.</p>
<p>18:26 One out of the bondservants of the high-priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter cut off, says, Did I not see you in the garden with him?</p>
<p>18:27 Then* Peter denied again and immediately the rooster crowed.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 
15:1 &amp; Mt 27:1-2 Lk 22:66-

<p>{Mk 15:2-5 &amp; Mt 27:11-14 &amp; Lk 23:2-5 &amp; Jn 18:28b-38 Jerusalem early Friday morning.}</p>
<p>18:28 Then* they lead Jesus from Caiaphas into the palace, and it was morning, and they themselves did not enter into the palace, that* they might not be defiled, but that* they might eat the Passover. 
18:29 Therefore, Pilate went out to them and said, What accusation are you* bringing against this man?</p>
<p>18:30 They answered and said to him, If this one were not an evildoer, we should not have given him up to you.</p>
<p>18:31 Therefore Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and judge him according to your* law.</p>
<p>Therefore the Jews said to him, It is not legal for us to kill anyone. 
18:32 <i>(This happened</i> in order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke signifying by what <i>sort of</i> death he was about to die.)</p>
<p>18:33 Therefore, Pilate entered again into the palace, and summoned Jesus and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?</p>
<p>18:34 Jesus answered him, <b>Do you say this from yourself or did others say <i>this</i> to you concerning me?</b></p>
<p>18:35 Pilate answered, I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the high-priests gave you to me. What have you done?</p>
<p>18:36 Jesus answered, <b>My kingdom is not from this world; if my kingdom were from this world, then my attendants would fight that* I might not be given up to the Jews, but now my kingdom is not from here.</b></p>
<p>18:37 Therefore Pilate said to him, Are you not a king?</p>
<p>Jesus answered, <b>You are saying that I am a king. I have been born to this <i>end</i> and I have come into the world to this <i>end</i>, that* I might testify to the truth. Everyone who is of* the truth hears my voice.</b></p>
<p>18:38 Pilate says to him, What is truth? And having said this, he went out again to the Jews and says to them, I am finding no crime in him.</p>
<p>{Mk 15:6-19 &amp; Mt 27:15-30 &amp; Jn 18:39-
19:16 Friday, April 7, 30AD.}</p>
<p>18:39 But it is a custom with you*, that* I should release to you* one <i>prisoner</i> at the Passover; therefore, do you* will that I should release to you* the King of the Jews?</p>
<p>18:40 Then* they all cried-out again, saying, Not this one, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</p>
<h3>John 19</h3>
<p>19:1 Therefore Pilate took Jesus and scourged him then. 
19:2 And the soldiers having braided a crown of thorns, placed it on his head and dressed him in a purple garment; 
19:3 and were saying, Hail, King of the Jews! And they were giving him slaps on the cheek.</p>
<p>19:4 Therefore Pilate went outside again and says to them, Behold, I lead him outside to you*, that* you* may know that I am finding no crime in him. 
19:5 Then* Jesus came outside, wearing the thorny crown and the purple garment. And <i>Pilate</i> says to them, Behold, the man!</p>
<p>19:6 Then* when the high-priests and the attendants saw him, they cried-out, saying, Crucify <i>him</i>, crucify him!</p>
<p>Pilate says to them, Take him yourselves and crucify him; for* I am finding no crime in him.</p>
<p>19:7 The Jews answered him, We have a law and according to our law he ought to die, because he made* himself the Son of God.</p>
<p>19:8 Then* when Pilate heard this word, he was more afraid; 
19:9 and he entered into the palace again and says to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no answer. 
19:10 Therefore Pilate says to him, <i>Why</i> do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and have authority to crucify you?</p>
<p>19:11 Jesus answered, <b>You have no authority against me, except <i>that</i> it was given to you from above. Because of this, he who gave me to you has <i>the</i> greater sin.</b></p>
<p>19:12 From that <i>time</i>, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews were crying out, saying, If you release this one, you are not Caesar’s friend. Everyone who makes* himself a king speaks against Caesar. 
19:13 Then* when* Pilate heard this word, he led Jesus outside and sat down upon the judicial-seat in a place called* The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 
19:14 But it was the Preparation of the Passover and was approximately the sixth hour {i.e. Noon}.</p>
<p>Now he says to the Jews, Behold, your* King!</p>
<p>19:15 But they cried-out, Take <i>him</i> away, take <i>him</i> away, crucify him!</p>
<p>Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your* King?</p>
<p>The high-priests answered, We have no king except Caesar. 
19:16 Therefore, he gave him to them then that* he might be crucified and they took Jesus and led <i>him away</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 15:20-23 &amp; Mt 27:31-34 &amp; Lk 23:26-33 &amp; Jn 
19:17 Road to the Cross, Friday morning.}</p>
<p>19:17 And he went out, bearing his cross, to the place called*, The Place of a Skull, <i>which</i> is called* in Hebrew, Golgotha,</p>
<p>{Mk 15:24-32 &amp; Mt 27:35-44 &amp; Lk 23:33-43 &amp; Jn 19:18-27 
9:00 AM to Noon, Friday.}</p>
<p>19:18 where they crucified him and two others with him, on this side and on that side and Jesus in the middle. 
19:19 But Pilate also wrote a title and placed it upon the cross. Now it was written, Jesus the Nazarene, the King of the Jews. 
19:20 Therefore, many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near to the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek and in Latin.</p>
<p>19:21 Therefore, the high-priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews, but, That man said, I am King of the Jews.</p>
<p>19:22 Pilate answered, I have written what I have written.</p>
<br>
<p>19:23 Therefore the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made* four parts, a part to each soldier, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was seamless from the top, <i>and was</i> entirely woven. 
19:24 Therefore they said to one another, We should not split-apart <i>this tunic</i>, but should do a lot concerning it; whose it will be. <i>This happened</i> in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, ‘They divided my garments among them and they cast a lot for my garment.’ {Psa 22. 18} Therefore indeed, the soldiers did these things. 
19:25 But, his mother and his mother’s sister, Mary the <i>wife</i> of Clopas and Mary the Magdalene stood beside the cross of Jesus.</p>
<p>19:26 Therefore, when* Jesus saw his mother and the disciple standing beside <i>her</i>, whom he loved*, he says to his mother, <b>Woman, behold your son!</b> 
19:27 Thereafter he says to the disciple, <b>Behold, your mother!</b> And from that hour the disciple took her to his own <i>home</i>.</p>

<p>{Mk 15:34-41 &amp; Mt 27:46-56 &amp; Lk 23:45-49 &amp; Jn 19:28-30 around 
5:00 PM.}</p>
<p>19:28 After this Jesus, knowing that all things have been completed, that* the Scripture might be completed, which says, <b>‘I am thirsty.’</b> {Psa 69:21} 
19:29 Therefore, a vessel was laying full of vinegar, and having filled a sponge with vinegar and having placed it around a hyssop, they brought it to his mouth. 
19:30 Therefore, when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, <b>It has been completed.</b> And he bowed his head and gave up the spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 15:42-47 &amp; Mt 27:57-66 &amp; Lk 23:50-56 &amp; Jn 19:31-42 Before The Sabbath.}</p>
<p>19:31 Therefore the Jews asked Pilate, that* the bodies should not remain upon the cross upon the Sabbath since it was the Preparation, (for* the day of that Sabbath was a high <i>day</i>), that* their legs might be fractured and <i>that</i>* they might be taken away. 
19:32 Therefore, the soldiers came, and indeed fractured the legs of the first and of the other <i>one</i> who was crucified together with him, 
19:33 but when* they came upon Jesus and saw that he had already died, they did not fracture his legs; 
19:34 but one of the soldiers pierced his ribs with a spear and immediately blood and water came out <i>of it</i>. 
19:35 And he who has seen, has testified and his testimony is true and he knows that he says true things, that* you* might believe. 
19:36 For* these things happened in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, ‘A bone of him will not be crushed.’ {Ex. 
12:46 &amp; Num. 
9:12 &amp; Psa 34:20} 
19:37 And again a different Scripture says, ‘They will look at him whom they stabbed.’ {Zech. 12:10}</p>
<br>
<p>19:38 After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus and having been hidden because of <i>his</i> fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that* he might take away the body of Jesus and Pilate permitted <i>him</i>. Therefore he came and took away his body. 
19:39 Now Nicodemus also came, he who came to Jesus the first <i>time</i> by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, approximately a hundred pounds <i>of it</i>. 
19:40 So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen-strips with the spices, just-as the custom of the Jews is for burial. 
19:41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which a man had not yet laid. 
19:42 Therefore they laid Jesus there because of the Jews’ Preparation, and because the tomb was near.</p>
<h3>John 20</h3>
<p>{Mk 16:1-8 &amp; Mt 28:1-8 &amp; Lk 24:1-8, 12 &amp; Jn 20:1-10 Dawn and very early Sunday.}</p>
<p>20:1 Now on the first <i>day</i> of the week Mary the Magdalene comes in the morning, it was still dark, to the tomb and sees the stone has been lifted away from the tomb. 
20:2 Therefore she runs and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved*, and says to them, They have taken away the Lord from the tomb and we do not know where they have laid him.</p>
<p>20:3 Therefore Peter went forth, and the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb. 
20:4 Now they both were running in unison and the other disciple ran ahead of Peter and came to the tomb first; 
20:5 and stooping down and looking in, he sees the linen-strips laying; nevertheless he did not enter in. 
20:6 Then* Simon Peter comes, following him and entered into the tomb, and he views the linen-strips laying, 
20:7 and the handkerchief which was upon his head, was not laying with the linen-strips, but has been entwined in a separate place. 
20:8 Therefore, the other disciple also entered in then, who came first to the tomb, and he saw and believed. 
20:9 (For* they did not yet know the Scripture, that it is essential for him to rise* up from the dead.) 
20:10 So the disciples went away again to themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 16:9-11 &amp; Mt 28:9-10 &amp; Lk 24:9-11 &amp; Jn 20:11-18.}</p>
<p>20:11 But Mary stood outside at the tomb, weeping. Therefore, as she was weeping, she peered into the tomb; 
20:12 and she views two messengers in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus was laying. 
20:13 And those <i>men</i> say to her, Woman, why do you weep?</p>
<p>She says to them, Because they have taken away my Lord and I do not know where they have laid him. 
20:14 And having said these things, she turned backward and views Jesus standing and did not know that it was Jesus.</p>
<p>20:15 Jesus says to her, <b>Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?</b></p>
<p>That <i>woman</i>, thinking that it is the gardener, says to him, Lord, if you bore him <i>away</i> from here, tell me where you have laid him and I will take him away.</p>
<p>20:16 Jesus says to her, <b>Mary</b>.</p>
<p>She having turned <i>around</i>, says to him, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.</p>
<p>20:17 Jesus says to her, <b>Do not be touching me; for* I have not yet ascended to the Father, but travel to my brethren and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your* Father and my God and your* God.</b></p>
<p>20:18 Mary the Magdalene comes, reporting to the disciples, that she has seen the Lord, and <i>that</i> he had said these things to her.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 
16:14 &amp; Lk 24:36-43 &amp; Jn 20:19-25 Sunday Evening.}</p>
<p>20:19 Therefore, when* it was evening on that day, the first <i>day</i> of the week, and when* the doors had been locked where the disciples were gathered because of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the middle, and says to them, <b>Peace to you*.</b> 
20:20 And having said this, he showed to them his hands and his ribs. Therefore the disciples rejoiced, having seen the Lord. 
20:21 Then* Jesus said to them again, <b>Peace to you*; just-as the Father has sent me; I am also sending you*.</b> 
20:22 And having said this, he infused <i>them</i> and says to them, <b>Receive the Holy Spirit.</b> 
20:23 <b>If you* forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven to them <i>by God</i>; if you* hold-fast anyone’s <i>sins, those sins</i> have been held-fast.</b> {Mt 16:19, 18:18}</p>
<br>
<p>20:24 But Thomas, one out of the twelve, called* Didymus {twin}, was not with them when Jesus came. 
20:25 Therefore, the other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord.</p>
<p>But they were saying to him, If I do not see the pattern of the nails in his hands and may put my finger into the pattern of the nails and may put my hand into his ribs, I will never* believe.</p>
<br>
<p>{Jn 20:26-31 &amp; 1Cor: 
15:5 Sunday after resurrection.}</p>
<p>20:26 And after eight days again his disciples were inside and Thomas with them. Jesus comes, the doors having been locked and stood in the middle and said,  <b>Peace to you*.</b> 
20:27 Thereafter he says to Thomas, <b>Bring your finger here and behold my hands, and bring your hand <i>here</i> and put it into my ribs and do not become unbelieving, but believing.</b></p>
<p>20:28 And Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God!</p>
<p>20:29 Jesus says to him, <b>Because you have seen me, you have believed<i>, but</i> those who have not seen and <i>yet</i> have believed <i>are</i> fortunate.</b></p>
<br>
<p>20:30 Therefore, Jesus indeed did many other signs also in the sight of his disciples, which are not written in this book; 
20:31 but these have been written, that* you* may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that* believing you* may have life in his name.</p>
<h3>John 21</h3>
<p>{Jn 21:1-25 Sea of Galilee; no parallel.}</p>
<p>21:1 After these things, Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples upon the sea of Tiberias, and he appeared so. 
21:2 They were united-together at Galilee: Simon Peter and Thomas called* Didymus and Nathanael of Cana and the <i>sons</i> of Zebedee and two others out of his disciples. 
21:3 Simon Peter says to them, I am going to fish.</p>
<p>They say to him, We are also coming together with you. They went forth and immediately entered into the ship, and they clutched nothing <i>in the net</i> in that night.</p>
<p>21:4 But having already become morning, Jesus stood at the beach; nevertheless the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 
21:5 Then* Jesus says to them, <b>Children, do you* have any fish?</b></p>
<p>They answered him, No.</p>
<p>21:6 But he said to them, <b>Cast the net toward the right part of the ship and you* will find <i>some</i>.</b> Therefore they cast <i>it</i>, and they were not strong-enough to drag it <i>into the</i>  ship away from the multitude of fish.</p>
<p>21:7 Therefore, that disciple whom Jesus loved* says to Peter, It is the Lord. Then* Simon Peter having heard that it was the Lord, he girded his <i>outer</i> clothing upon himself (for* he {F} was naked) and cast himself into the sea. 
21:8 But the other disciples came in the small-boat (for* they were not far from the land, but approximately two hundred cubits from it), dragging the net <i>full</i> of fish. 
21:9 Then* as they stepped to the land, they see a coal-fire laying <i>there</i> and a little-fish laying on <i>it</i> and bread.</p>
<p>21:10 Jesus says to them, <b>Bring <i>some</i> of the little-fish which you* have now clutched <i>in the net</i>.</b> 
21:11 Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to the land, full of great fish, a hundred and fifty-three and there were so-many, <i>yet</i> the net was not split-apart. 
21:12 Jesus says to them, <b>Come-here. Have a meal</b>.</p>
<p>But none of the disciples were daring to probe him, Who are you? Knowing that it was the Lord. 
21:13 Then* Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives <i>it</i> to them and the little-fish likewise. 
21:14 This is already the third-time that Jesus was manifested to his disciples, after he was raised from the dead.</p>
<br>
<p>21:15 Then* when they had broken their fast, Jesus says to Simon Peter, <b>Simon, <i>Son</i> of Jonah, do you</b> {F} <b>love* me more-than these things?</b></p>
<p>He says to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I {F} love you.</p>
<p>He says to him, <b>Feed my lambs.</b></p>
<p>21:16 He says to him again a second-time, <b>Simon, <i>Son</i> of Jonah, do you</b> {F} <b>love* me?</b></p>
<p>He says to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I {F} love you.</p>
<p>He says to him, <b>Shepherd my sheep.</b></p>
<p>21:17 He says to him the third-time, <b>Simon, <i>Son</i> of Jonah, Do you</b> {F} <b>love me?</b></p>
<p>Peter was sorrowful because he said to him the third-time, Do you {F} love me <i>like a friend</i>? And he said to him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I {F} love you <i>like a friend</i>.</p>
<p>Jesus says to him, <b>Feed my sheep.</b> 
21:18 <b>Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you, When you were younger, you were girding yourself and were walking where you were wishing <i>to go</i>, but whenever you are elderly, you will stretch out your hands and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish.</b> 
21:19 Now he spoke this signifying by what <i>sort of</i> death he should glorify God. And having said this, he says to him, <b>Follow me.</b></p>
<p>21:20 But Peter, turning again, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved* following; who also leaned-back upon his chest at the supper and <i>who had</i> said, Lord, who is he who is giving you up? 
21:21 Peter seeing him says to Jesus, Lord and what <i>about</i> this one?</p>
<p>21:22 Jesus says to him, <b>If I will <i>for</i> him to abide until I come, what <i>is that</i> pertaining to you? You, follow me!</b></p>
<p>21:23 Therefore, this speech went forth to the brethren, that, that disciple does not die. And <i>yet</i> Jesus did not say to him that he does not die, but, <b>If I will that he remains until I come, what <i>is that</i> pertaining to you?</b></p>
<br>
<p>21:24 This is the disciple who is testifying concerning these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true.</p>
<p>21:25 Now there are also many other things <i>testifying to</i> how-much Jesus did, which if they are written every one, I assume that not even the world itself <i>could</i> make* room for the written books.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

<h3>Acts 1</h3>
<p>{Events from 30 - 63 AD are recorded including all the examples of Christian conversions. Tiberius Caesar, Emperor, 14-37 AD. Pontius Pilate, governor of Judea. Herod Antipas, governor of Galilee.}</p>
<br>
<p>1:1 O Theophilus, I indeed made* the first account concerning all that Jesus began both to do and to teach, 
1:2 till the day in which he was received up, having commanded through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.</p>
<br>
<p>{Lk 24:44-49 &amp; Acts 1:3-8 &amp; 1Cor: 
15:7 Jerusalem.}</p>
<p>1:3 <i>The apostles</i> to whom, he also presented himself <i>as</i> living in many definite-proofs after he had suffered <i>on the cross</i>, being seen by them through<i>out</i> forty days and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God. 
1:4 And, being assembled {Or: eating} together with <i>them</i>, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to remain <i>until</i> the promise of the Father, <b>Which,</b> (<i>he said)</i> <b>You* <i>have</i> heard from me;</b> 
1:5 <b>because John indeed immersed* in water, but you* will be immersed* in the Holy Spirit after not many days.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{May 18, 30AD Mount of Olives.}</p>
<p>1:6 Therefore indeed, having come together, they asked him, saying, Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?</p>
<p>1:7 Now he said to them, <b>It is not yours* to know times or seasons, which the Father placed in his own authority.</b> 
1:8 <b>But you* will receive power when* the Holy Spirit comes upon you*, and you* will be witnesses to me, both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the outermost <i>parts</i> of the earth</b>.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mk 16:19-20 &amp; Lk 24:50-53 &amp; Acts 1:9-12 Olivet, between Jerusalem and Bethany.}</p>
<p>1:9 And having said these things, <i>and whil</i>e looking <i>at him</i>, he was lifted up, and a cloud received him out of their <i>staring</i> eyes. 
1:10 And as they were staring, when* he went-onward into heaven, behold, two men stood beside them in white apparel; 
1:11 who also said, Men, Galileans! Why are you* standing <i>here</i>, looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was received up from you* into heaven will come <i>back</i> thus in the manner you* saw him going-onward into heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>1:12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey off. 
1:13 And having entered, they went up into the upstairs room, where they were remaining; both Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James <i>the son</i> of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas <i>the son</i> of James {Or: brother. See Jude.}. 
1:14 All these <i>men</i> together with <i>the</i> women and Mary the mother of Jesus and together with his brethren were persevering, united in prayer and supplication.</p>
<br>
<p>1:15 And Peter stood up in these days in the midst of the disciples (and a crowd of people {Greek: names. See: Rev. 3:4.} were in the same <i>place</i>, approximately a hundred and twenty) and said, 
1:16 Brethren, it was essential that this Scripture might be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit said beforehand through <i>the</i> mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who took Jesus, 
1:17 because he was numbered together with us and was allotted his inheritance in this service.</p>
<br>
<p>{Mt 27:3-10 &amp; Acts 1:18-19.}</p>
<p>1:18 (Therefore indeed, this one procured a parcel of ground from the reward of <i>his</i> unrighteousness, and he happened to fall-flat and ruptured in the middle and all his bowels were poured out. 
1:19 And it became known to all the dwellers in Jerusalem; so-that in their own language this place was called Akeldama, that is, The Place of Blood.) 
1:20 For* it has been written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his habitation become desolate and do not let there be one dwelling in it’ {Psa 69:25} and, ‘Let a different <i>one</i> take his overseership.’ {Psa 109:8} 
1:21 Therefore, of those <i>men</i> who have come together with us all the time that the Lord Jesus entered <i>in</i> and went out among us, 
1:22 beginning from the immersion* of John, to the day that he was received up from us, it is essential one of these <i>is</i> to become a witness together with us of his resurrection. 
1:23 And they stood up two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus and Matthias. 
1:24 And <i>after</i> praying, they said, You Lord, knower of the hearts of all, show which one out of these two you have chosen 
1:25 to receive the inheritance of this service and apostleship from which Judas transgressed, <i>so as</i> to go-onward to his own place. 
1:26 And they gave <i>them</i> their lots and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was enumerated together with the eleven apostles.</p>

<br>
<p>{Pentecost (always Sunday) May 28, 30AD Jerusalem.  <b>Pentecost</b> is a transliterated word, G4005, which literal means ‘50th’ as in the 50th day after Passover.}</p>
<p>2:1 And while* the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled, they were united in the same <i>place.</i> 
2:2 And suddenly there became a noise from heaven just-like <i>the</i> bringing of a violent wind and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. 
2:3 And there appeared to them, divided tongues, like fire, and it sat upon each one of them. 
2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, just-as the Spirit was giving to them to speak out. 
2:5 Now Jews were dwelling in Jerusalem, devout men, from every nation under heaven. 
2:6 But when* the {F} voice from this happened, the multitude came together and was confused, because each one was hearing them speaking in his own language. 
2:7 Now they were astonished and marveling, saying to one another, Behold, are these not all Galileans who are speaking? 
2:8 And how are we hearing each one in our own language in which we were born? 
2:9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, 
2:10 in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya toward Cyrene and the inhabiting Romans, both Jews and Jewish-converts, 
2:11 Cretans and Arabs, we hear them speaking in our languages the magnificent things of God. 
2:12 Now all were astonished and were perplexed, saying to one another, What might this mean {Greek: wish to be}? 
2:13 But others sneering, were saying, They are full of new-wine.</p>
<br>
<p>{Examples of those who were saved in the New Testament: Acts 2:14-42; 8:5-13; 8:30-39; 9:17-18, 22:6-16, 26:12-18; 10:34-48; 16:13-15; 16:25-34; 18:8; 19:1-7.}</p>
<p>2:14 But Peter, standing up together with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke out to them, saying, Men, Jews and all you* who are dwelling <i>in</i> Jerusalem, let this be known to you* and notice my words. 
2:15 For* these <i>men</i> are not drunken, as you* take <i>it to be</i>; for* it is <i>only</i> the third hour {i.e. 
9:00 AM} of the day. 
2:16 But this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel, 
2:17 God says, ‘And it will be in the last days, I will pour out from My Spirit upon all flesh and your* sons and your* daughters will prophesy and your* young-men will see visions and your* elderly-men will dream dreams. 
2:18 For-sure, upon my <i>male</i> bondservants and upon my <i>female</i> bondservants in those days I will pour out of my Spirit, and they will prophesy. 
2:19 And I will give <i>you*</i> wonders in the heaven above and signs upon the earth below; blood and fire and vapor of smoke. 
2:20 The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the great and illustrious day of the Lord comes. 
2:21 And it will be, that everyone, whoever calls upon the name of the Lord, will be saved.’ {Joel 2:28-32}</p>
<p>2:22 Men, Israelites! Hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man from God, having been shown to you* by miracles and wonders and signs which God did through him in your* midst, just-as you* yourselves also know; 
2:23 being given up by what had been determined by the counsel and foreknowledge of God, you* assassinated <i>him</i>, having taken <i>him</i> and fastened <i>him</i> to <i>a cross</i> through lawless hands; 
2:24 whom God raised* up, having loosed the travail of death, insomuch as it was not possible <i>for him</i> to be held-fast by it. 
2:25 For* David says <i>in regard</i> to him, ‘I am seeing the Lord always before my face, in <i>my</i> sight, because he is at my right <i>hand</i>, that* I might not be shaken. 
2:26 Because of this, my heart was joyous and my tongue was glad. Now my flesh will also reside in hope; 
2:27 because you will not forsake my soul to Hades, neither will you give your Holy One to see decay. 
2:28 You made known to me the ways of life. You will fill me with joy with your countenance.’ {Psa 16:8-11} 
2:29 Brethren, it is legal <i>for me</i> to speak publicly to you* concerning the patriarch David, that he is both dead* and was buried and his tomb is among us to this day. 
2:30 Therefore being* a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that from the fruit of his loins, to raise* up the Christ according to the flesh to sit upon his throne. {Psa 89:3-4, 132:11} 
2:31 Foreseeing this, he spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was his soul left to Hades, nor did his flesh see decay. {Psa 16:10} 
2:32 This Jesus, God raised* up, of whom we are all witnesses. 
2:33 Therefore being exalted by the right <i>hand</i> of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out this, which you* are seeing and hearing now. 
2:34 For* David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right <i>hand</i>, 
2:35 until I should place your enemies <i>as the</i> footstool of your feet.’ {Psa 110:1} 
2:36 Therefore, let all the house of Israel know with certainty, that God has made* him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you* crucified.</p>
<br>
<p>2:37 Now when* they heard <i>this,</i> they were pierced in their heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?</p>
<p>2:38 Now Peter said to them, Repent and be immersed* each one of you* in the name of Jesus Christ to <i>obtain</i> the forgiveness of <i>your</i>* sins {F}, and you* will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
2:39 For* to you* is the promise and to your* children and to all who are from afar, as many as the Lord our God may call to him. 
2:40 Now he was thoroughly testifying and encouraging them with many other words, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation. 
2:41 Therefore indeed, they, who gladly accepted his word, were immersed*, and approximately three thousand souls was added <i>to them</i> in that day. 
2:42 Now they were persevering in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship and in the breaking of the bread and prayers.</p>
<br>
<p>2:43 Now there became fear upon every soul and many wonders and signs were happening through the apostles. 
2:44 But all who believed were in the same <i>mind</i> and had all things common. 
2:45 They were selling* their properties and possessions and dividing them to all, insomuch as anyone was having a need. 
2:46 And persevering, united in the temple and breaking bread in <i>their</i> houses daily, they were taking their nourishment in gladness and simplicity of heart, 
2:47 praising God, and having favor with the whole people. Now the Lord was adding to the {F} congregation* those who are saved daily.</p>
<br>
<p>{Footnotes: Acts 2:6, this was a miraculous event, the crowd heard all this like a single voice from afar or figuratively like ‘noisy or sounds.’</p>

<p>{June 30, 30AD Temple at Jerusalem.}</p>
<p>3:1 Now Peter and John were going up at the same <i>time</i> into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth <i>hour</i> {i.e. 
3:00 PM}. 
3:2 And a certain man, being* lame from his mother’s womb, was being bore <i>there</i>, whom they were laying daily at the door of the temple which is called* Beautiful, to ask charity of those who travel into the temple. 
3:3 Seeing Peter and John being about to go into the temple, he asked <i>them for</i> charity. 
3:4 But Peter, together with John, staring toward him, said, Look toward us. 
3:5 Now he was taking-heed of them, expecting to receive something from them. 
3:6 But Peter said, I do not possess silver and gold, but what I have, that I am giving to you. In the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, arise and walk. 
3:7 And he clutched him by the right <i>hand</i> and lifted him up and instantly his feet and his ankles were strengthened. 
3:8 And leaping up, he stood and was walking, and he entered together with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God. 
3:9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God. 
3:10 And they were recognizing him, that it was he who sat for charity at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with amazement and astonishment at what has befallen him.</p>
<br>
<p>3:11 Now <i>while</i> the lame <i>man,</i> who had been healed, <i>was</i> holding-fast <i>to</i> Peter and John, all the people ran together to them on the porch <i>which is</i> called Solomon’s, <i>and were</i> utterly amazed. 
3:12 Now when* Peter saw it, he answered to the people, Men, Israelites! Why are you* marveling over this one? Or why are you* staring upon us, as <i>though</i> by <i>our</i> own power or godliness* we have made* him <i>able</i> to walk? 
3:13 The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his young-servant Jesus; whom you* indeed gave up and denied him in the face of Pilate, when* he <i>had</i> decided to release that <i>man</i>. 
3:14 But you* denied the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you*, 
3:15 and killed the Author of life; whom God raised <i>up</i> from the dead; of whom we are witnesses. 
3:16 And upon the faith of his name, this one whom you* are viewing and know, his name has strengthened him. And the faith which is through him has given him this wholeness <i>of body</i> in front of you* all. 
3:17 And I know now brethren that you* did it according to ignorance, just-like also <i>did</i> your* rulers. 
3:18 But what God proclaimed beforehand through the mouth of all the prophets, <i>that</i> the Christ <i>would</i> suffer, he thus fulfilled. 
3:19 Therefore, repent and turn again, *that* your* sins may be wiped-away, that seasons of relaxation may come from the presence of the Lord; 
3:20 and <i>that</i> he may send Christ Jesus who has been assigned to you*; 
3:21 whom it is indeed essential for the heaven to accept till the times of restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouth of all his holy prophets that have been from of old. 
3:22 Moses indeed said to the fathers, The Lord our God will rise* up for you* a prophet from among your* brethren, like me. You* will listen to him according to all things, as many things as he may speak to you*. 
3:23 And it will be, that every soul if it does not listen to that prophet, will be utterly destroyed from among the people. 
3:24 But even all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed afterwards, as many as have spoken, also <i>spoke of</i> these days. 
3:25 You* are <i>the</i> sons of the prophets and of the covenant* which God covenanted with our fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your seed, all the families of the earth will be blessed.’ {Gen. 22:18, 26:4, 28:14} 
3:26 God, having raised* up his young-servant Jesus, sent him to you* first, blessing you* in turning each of you* away from your* wickednesses.</p>
<h3>Acts 4</h3>
<p>4:1 Now <i>while</i> speaking to the people, the priests and the magistrate of the temple and the Sadducees stood by them, 
4:2 being pained, because they taught the people and proclaimed the resurrection of the dead in Jesus. 
4:3 And they put hands on them and placed them in jail *for the next-day; for* it was already dusk. 
4:4 But many of those who heard the word believed, and <i>the</i> number of the men happened to be approximately five thousand.</p>
<br>
<p>4:5 Now it happened upon the next-day, that their rulers and the elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem; 
4:6 and Annas the high-priest <i>was there</i> and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and as many as were from <i>the</i> high-priestly race. 
4:7 And having stood them in the middle, they were inquiring, By what power or in what name, have you* done this?</p>
<p>4:8 Then Peter, having been filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, You* rulers of the people and elders of Israel, 
4:9 if we are examined today on <i>the basis of</i> a good* work <i>done to</i> a sick man and by what <i>means</i> this one has been cured. 
4:10 Let it be known to you*, to all <i>here</i> and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, whom you* crucified, whom God raised <i>up</i> from the dead; in him, this one who is standing in your* sight <i>is</i> healthy. 
4:11 He is, ‘The stone scorned by you*, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.’{Psa 118:22} 
4:12 And there is salvation in none other; for* neither is there any other name, that has been given among men, in which it is essential <i>for</i> us to be saved.</p>
<br>
<p>4:13 Now viewing the boldness of Peter and John, they were marveling, having comprehended that they were illiterate and unskilled men. And they recognized them, that they had been together with Jesus. 
4:14 But seeing the man who has been healed, standing together with them, they had nothing to speak against it. 
4:15 But having commanded them to go aside, outside the council, they were pondering <i>these things</i> with one another, 
4:16 saying, What shall we do to these men? For* that indeed a known sign has happened through them and apparent to all who are dwelling in Jerusalem, and we are not able to deny it. 
4:17 But in order that it should not circulate, more-than <i>this</i> into the people, we will threaten them with <i>more</i> threatening, to no longer speak to anyone in this name. 
4:18 And they called them <i>back</i> and commanded them not to speak in anyway nor teach in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>4:19 But Peter and John answered and said to them, Judge for yourselves if it is right in God’s sight to listen to you* rather than to God. 
4:20 For* we are not able to speak, but the things which we saw and heard. 
4:21 But having additionally threatened them, they released them, finding nothing as to how they will punish them, because of the people, because all were glorifying God for what has happened. 
4:22 For* the man was more-than forty years old, on whom this sign of healing had happened.</p>
<br>
<p>4:23 Now being released, they came to their own <i>brethren</i> and reported how-much the high-priests and the elders had said to them. 
4:24 Now they, having heard <i>it</i>, lifted up their voice to God united and said, O Lord, you <i>are</i> the God who made* the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them; 
4:25 who through the mouth of our father David your young-servant, said, ‘Why do the Gentiles rage and the peoples meditate on empty things? 
4:26 The kings of the earth stood <i>up</i> and the rulers were gathered in the same <i>place</i>, against the Lord and against his Christ.’ {Psa 2:1-2} 
4:27 For* against truth, against your holy young-servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, together with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together 
4:28 to do as many things as your hand and your council predetermined to happen. 
4:29 And hereafter, Lord, look upon their threats and give to your bondservants to speak your word with all boldness, 
4:30 by you stretching out your hand *for healing, and signs and wonders to happen through the name of your holy young-servant Jesus. 
4:31 And having besought <i>the Lord</i>, the place was shaken in which they were gathered together, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and they were speaking the word of God with boldness.</p>
<br>
<p>4:32 Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul and not one <i>of them</i> said that anything of his possessions was his own, but they had all things common. 
4:33 Now the apostles were giving their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power and great grace was upon them all. 
4:34 For* neither anyone among them was* needy. For* as many as were* owners of parcels of ground or houses, were selling <i>them</i> and were bringing the prices of the things that were sold*, 
4:35 and were laying them by the apostles’ feet and were being distributed to each, insomuch as anyone was having a need.</p>
<br>
<p>4:36 Now Joses, who was surnamed Barnabas from the apostles, (which is, being translated, Son of Encouragement), a Levite from Cyprus by birth, 
4:37 sold a field, possessed by him, and brought the monies and laid it by the apostles’ feet.</p>
<h3>Acts 5</h3>
<p>{Late 30 AD - 36 AD Temple at Jerusalem.}</p>
<p>5:1 But a certain man, Ananias by name, together with his wife Sapphira, sold a property, 
5:2 and pilfered <i>part</i> of the price, his wife also having been conscious <i>of it</i>, and brought a certain part, laid it by the apostles’ feet. 
5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why has the Adversary filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to pilfer <i>part</i> of the price of the parcel of ground? 
5:4 When* it remained <i>unsold</i>, was it not remaining yours? And when* it was sold*, was* it <i>not still</i> in your authority? Why did you purpose this matter in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God. 
5:5 But Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and expired, and there became great fear upon all those who heard these things. 
5:6 Now when* the younger-men stood up, they enshrouded him and carried him out and buried him.</p>
<br>
<p>5:7 Now it happened <i>after</i> an interval of approximately three hours, his wife also came in, not knowing what has happened. 
5:8 But Peter answered her, Tell me if you* were given so-much <i>for</i> the parcel of ground?</p>
<p>And she said, Yes, <i>for</i> so much.</p>
<p>5:9 But Peter said to her, Why <i>is it</i> that you* have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out. 
5:10 Now she fell down instantly by his feet and expired and the young-men came in and found her dead and they carried her out and buried her by her husband. 
5:11 Now there became great fear upon the whole congregation* and upon all who heard these things.</p>
<br>
<p>5:12 Now through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were happening among the people, and they were all united in Solomon’s porch. 
5:13 But no one of the rest were daring to join himself to them, but the people were extolling them; 
5:14 and more believers, multitudes of both men and women, were added to the Lord; 
5:15 so-that they <i>even</i> carried out the sick in the streets to lay <i>them</i> upon cots and pallets, that*, when* Peter came <i>by</i>, if-only his shadow might overshadow anyone of them. 
5:16 Now the multitudes were also coming together from the cities in and around to Jerusalem, carrying sick ones, and those who were troubled by unclean spirits, who all were being healed.</p>
<br>
<p>5:17 But the high-priest stood up and all those who were together with him (which is a sect of the Sadducees) and they were filled <i>up</i> from jealousy, 
5:18 and they put their hands upon the apostles and placed them in <i>the</i> public jail. 
5:19 But a messenger of the Lord through <i>the</i> night, opened the doors of the prison and led them out and said, 
5:20 Travel, and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life. 
5:21 Now having heard <i>this</i>, they entered into the temple under the <i>light of</i> daybreak and were teaching. But the high-priest came and those who were together with him and called the Sanhedrin together and the Elderly-Council of the sons of Israel and sent to the prison to have them led <i>out</i>. 
5:22 But the attendants who came did not find them in the prison. Now having turned back, they reported, 
5:23 saying, We indeed found the prison, having been locked with* all <i>the</i> security <i>intact</i>, and the guards standing outside before the doors, but having opened <i>it</i>, we found no one inside. 
5:24 Now as both the magistrate of the temple and the priest heard these words and <i>with</i> the high-priests, they were perplexed concerning them <i>and</i> whatever had happened.</p>
<p>5:25 But someone, having come, reported to them, Behold, the men, whom you* placed in the prison yourselves, are in the temple standing and teaching the people. 
5:26 Then the magistrate went together with the attendants and led them, <i>but</i> without violence; for* they were fearing the people (that* they might not be stoned). 
5:27 Now having led them, they stood <i>them</i> before the council. And the high-priest asked them, 
5:28 saying, Did we command you* with a <i>strict</i> command to not teach in this name? And behold, you* have filled Jerusalem with your* teaching, and are planning to bring* this man’s blood upon us.</p>
<p>5:29 But Peter and the apostles answered and said, It is essential <i>for</i> us to obey God rather than men. 
5:30 The God of our fathers raised <i>up</i> Jesus, whom you* exterminated, hanging <i>him</i> upon a tree. 
5:31 <i>Jesus is the</i> Author and Savior who God exalted to his right <i>hand</i>, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. 
5:32 And we are witnesses of these words, and <i>so is</i> the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.</p>
<p>5:33 But hearing <i>this</i>, they were being infuriated and were counseling to assassinate them. 
5:34 But a certain one in the council stood up there, a Pharisee, Gamaliel by name, a teacher of the law, honored by all the people, and he commanded <i>them</i> to make* the apostles <i>wait</i> outside for a certain bit <i>of time</i>. 
5:35 And he said to them, Men, Israelites! Take-heed to yourselves what you* are about to do against these men. 
5:36 For* before these days rose* up Theudas, giving himself out to be someone, who was assassinated; to whom a number of men, approximately four hundred, joined themselves; and all, as many as were obeying him were disbanded and came* to nothing. 
5:37 After this one rose* up Judas, a Galilean, in the days of the census and a considerable <i>number of</i> people withdrew after him. He also perished, and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered. 
5:38 And hereafter I say to you*, Withdraw from these men and permit them <i>to continue,</i> because if this counsel or this work is from men, it will be torn-down; 
5:39 but if it is from God, you* will not be able to tear it down; lest you* might be found even to be quarreling against God.</p>
<p>5:40 Now they were persuaded by him, and having called the apostles to them, they whipped them, and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus and released them. 
5:41 Therefore indeed, they were traveling from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were deemed worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the name of Jesus. 
5:42 And they were not ceasing to teach and to proclaim Jesus <i>as</i> the Christ every day in the temple and in their house.</p>
<h3>Acts 6</h3>
<p>{Autumn 36 AD. Temple at Jerusalem. Pontius Pilate deposed.}</p>
<p>6:1 Now in the days when* the disciples were multiplying, there became a murmuring from the Grecian Jews <i>aimed</i> toward the Hebrews, because their widows were being left unattended in the daily service. 
6:2 Now the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them and said, It is not pleasing <i>to God for</i> us <i>to be</i>  leaving the word of God to serve tables. 
6:3 Therefore brethren, elect from you* seven men well testified of, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we might designate over this need. 
6:4 But we will persevere in prayer and in the service of the word. 
6:5 And the speech pleased the whole multitude and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolaus a Jewish-convert from Antioch; 
6:6 whom they stood in the sight of the apostles and having prayed, they laid their hands upon them.</p>
<br>
<p>6:7 And the word of God was growing, and the number of the disciples were extremely multiplying in Jerusalem, and a large crowd of the priests were obedient* to the faith.</p>
<br>
<p>6:8 And Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people. 
6:9 But there stood up some of those who were of the synagogue called* <i>the Synagogue</i> of the Freedmen both <i>those</i> from Cyrene and from Alexandria, and those from Cilicia and Asia, debating together with Stephen. 
6:10 And they were not strong-enough to stand against the wisdom and the Spirit by which he was speaking. 
6:11 Then they instigated men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous declarations at Moses and God. 
6:12 And they agitated the people and the elders and the scribes and standing against <i>him</i>, seized him and led him into the council.</p>
<p>6:13 And false witnesses stood up, who said, This man does not cease to speak blasphemous declarations against this holy place and the law; 
6:14 for* we have heard him say, that this Jesus the Nazarene will tear-down this place and will change the customs which Moses gave to us. 
6:15 And all who sat in the council, staring toward him, saw his face <i>was</i> like the face of a messenger.</p>
<h3>Acts 7</h3>
<p>7:1 Now the high-priest said, Are then these things so?</p>
<p>7:2 Now he said, Brethren and fathers, listen: the God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when* he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, 
7:3 and said to him, Come out of your land and from your relatives and come-here into the land which I will show you. 
7:4 Then when* he came out of the land of the Chaldeans, he dwelt in Haran and after his father died, <i>God</i> exiled him from there, into this land in which you* are now dwelling. 
7:5 And he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a step of <i>his</i> foot, and he promised to give it to him and to his seed after him *for <i>his</i> territory, <i>even</i> when* there was no child <i>yet</i> to him. 
7:6 Now God spoke thus: That his seed will be a foreigner in an alien land, and they will enslave them and mistreat them <i>for</i> four hundred years. 
7:7 And <i>God</i> said, I will judge the nation to which they may be enslaved, and they will come forth and give-divine service to me in this place after these <i>things</i>. 
7:8 And he gave him the covenant* of circumcision and so <i>to Abraham</i> was born Isaac and he circumcised him <i>on</i> the eighth day, and <i>to</i> Isaac <i>was born</i> Jacob and <i>to</i> Jacob the twelve patriarchs. 
7:9 And the patriarchs, having been jealous of Joseph, gave him into Egypt. And God was with him, 
7:10 and liberated him from all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom in front of Pharaoh king of Egypt, who designated him leader over Egypt and his whole house. 
7:11 Now there came a famine and great affliction upon the whole of Egypt and Canaan and our fathers were finding no sustenance. 
7:12 But when* Jacob heard of grain being in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time. 
7:13 And by the second-time, Joseph was recognized by his brethren, and Joseph’s race became apparent to the Pharaoh. 
7:14 But Joseph himself, having sent <i>them</i>, called Jacob, his father, and all the relatives, seventy five souls. 
7:15 Now Jacob went down into Egypt and is dead*, he himself and our fathers; 
7:16 and were transferred to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham purchased for a price in silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem. 
7:17 Now just-as the time of the promise was drawing near, which God swore to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, 
7:18 till there rose* up a different king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. 
7:19 This one dealt craftily with our race and mistreated our fathers, making* <i>them</i> place their babies outside <i>in the elements</i>, *that* they might not live. 
7:20 In which season, Moses was born and was handsome to God, and he was nourished three months in his father’s house. 
7:21 Now when* he had been placed outside <i>in the elements</i>, Pharaoh’s daughter took <i>him</i> for herself and reared him *for her own son.</p>
<p>7:22 Now Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in his words and works. 
7:23 Now as the time of forty years was being fulfilled to him, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel. 
7:24 And seeing a certain one <i>of them</i> being hurt, he retaliated and did <i>the</i> avenging for him who was subjugated, striking the Egyptian; 
7:25 and he was supposing that his brethren understood that God is giving them salvation through his hand. But they did not understand. 
7:26 And he appeared the next <i>day</i> to those who were quarreling and drove them to <i>make</i> peace, saying, Men, you* are brethren! Why are you* wronging one another? 
7:27 But he who hurt his neighbor thrust him away, saying, Who designated you a ruler and a justice over us? 
7:28 You do not wish to assassinate me in the manner you assassinated the Egyptian yesterday, do you?</p>
<p>7:29 But at this speech, Moses fled and became a foreigner in the land of Midian, where two sons were born <i>to him</i>. 
7:30 Now when* forty years were fulfilled, a messenger of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush. 
7:31 But when* Moses saw it, he was marveling <i>at</i> the vision <i>of it</i>, and when* he came near to consider <i>what it was,</i> there came* a voice of the Lord to him, 
7:32 <b>I <i>am</i> the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</b> And the trembling Moses came*, <i>and</i> was not daring to consider <i>what it was</i>. 
7:33 Now the Lord said to him, Loose the shoes from your feet; for* the place in which you are standing is holy land. 
7:34 <i>In</i> seeing, I have seen the mistreatment of my people who <i>are</i> in Egypt and have heard their groaning and I have come down to liberate them. And now come-here, I will send you into Egypt. 
7:35 This Moses whom they deny, saying, Who designated you a ruler and a justice? God sent him <i>to be</i> both a ruler and a redeemer by the hand of the messenger that appeared to him in the bush. 
7:36 This one led them forth, having done wonders and signs in <i>the</i> land of Egypt and in <i>the</i> Red Sea and in the wilderness <i>for</i> forty years. 
7:37 This is that Moses, who said to the sons of Israel, The Lord our God will raise* up to you* a prophet out of your* brethren, like me. 
7:38 This is he who came* <i>to be</i> in the congregation* in the wilderness with the messenger who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and from our fathers. <i>This is he</i> who accepted <i>the</i> living word to give to us; 
7:39 to whom our fathers willed not to become obedient*, but thrust him from themselves and turned back to Egypt in their hearts, 
7:40 saying to Aaron, Make* us gods that will travel before us. For* this Moses, who led us forth out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him. 
7:41 And they made* a calf in those days and brought* a sacrifice to the idol and were being joyous in the works of their hands. 
7:42 But God turned and gave them up to give-divine service to the army of heaven; just-as it has been written in the book of the prophets, ‘You* did not offer slaughtered <i>beasts</i> and sacrifices to me <i>for</i> forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel, did you*? 
7:43 And you* took up the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of the god Remphan, the patterns which you* made* to worship and I will exile you* past Babylon.’ {Amos 5:25-27} 
7:44 The tabernacle of the testimony was among our fathers in the wilderness, just-as he, who spoke to Moses, commanded <i>him</i> to make* it according to the pattern which he had seen. 
7:45 Which also our fathers, having accepted in succession, brought* in with Joshua, in the territory of the nations, that God thrust out before the face of our fathers, until the days of David. 
7:46 <i>David</i>, who found favor in God’s sight, asked to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. 
7:47 But Solomon built him a house. 
7:48 But the Highest is not dwelling in temples made* with hands; just-as the prophet says, 
7:49 ‘The heaven is my throne and the earth the footstool of my feet. What <i>sort of</i> house will you* build me? says the Lord. Or what is the place of my rest? 
7:50 Did not my hand make* all these things?’ {Isa 66:1-2}</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>7:51 You* <i>are</i> stiff-necked and non-circumcised in heart and ears. You* are habitually defying the Holy Spirit <i>just</i> like your* fathers did, so do you*! 
7:52 Which of the prophets did your* fathers not persecute? And they killed those who proclaimed beforehand <i>God’s message</i> concerning the coming of the Righteous One; of whom you* have now become betrayers and murderers. 
7:53 You* who received the law at <i>the</i> commandment from <i>God’s</i> messengers and did not observe it.</p>
<p>7:54 Now hearing these things, they were being infuriated in their hearts and they were gnashing their teeth at him. 
7:55 But possessing <i>the</i> full<i>ness</i> of the Holy Spirit, he stared into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at <i>the</i> right <i>hand</i> of God, 
7:56 and said, Behold, I am viewing the heavens that have been opened and the Son of Man standing at <i>the</i> right <i>hand</i> of God. 
7:57 But they cried out with a loud voice and held their ears <i>together</i>, and united, rushed upon him; 
7:58 and they cast him outside the city and were stoning him. And the witnesses placed <i>their</i> garments by the feet of a young-man called Saul. 
7:59 And they were stoning Stephen, <i>who was</i> calling upon <i>the Lord</i>, saying, Lord Jesus, accept my spirit. 
7:60 Now having placed his knees <i>down</i>, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, do not weigh this, <i>their</i> sin, to them. And having said this, he fell-asleep. <h3>Acts 8</h3> 
8:1 Now Saul was consenting to the assassination of him.</p>
<br>
<p>Now there became a great persecution in that day upon the congregation* which was in Jerusalem, and they were all dispersed throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except* the apostles. 
8:2 Now devout men entombed Stephen and made* great a lamentation over him. 
8:3 Now Saul was devastating the {F} congregation*, traveling into every house and dragging men and women <i>away,</i> he was giving them up to prison.</p>
<br>
<p>{37 AD. Samaria. Tiberius Caesar dies March 16. Caligula attempts to put his statue in the Temple. Examples of those who were saved in the New Testament: Acts 2:14-42; 8:5-13; 8:30-39; 9:17-18, 22:6-16, 26:12-18; 10:34-48; 16:13-15; 16:25-34; 18:8; 19:1-7.}</p>
<p>8:4 Therefore indeed, those who were dispersed went through<i>out the land</i>, proclaiming the word.</p>
<p>8:5 Now Philip went down to a city of Samaria and was preaching to them the Christ. 
8:6 And the crowds united <i>and</i> were taking-heed to the things that were spoken by Philip, while* they were hearing and seeing the signs which he was doing. 
8:7 For* many of those who had unclean spirits, they, <i>the spirits</i>, were coming out, crying with a loud voice. And many who have been paralyzed and who were lame, were healed. 
8:8 And there became much joy in that city.</p>
<br>
<p>8:9 But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who was formerly in the city practicing-magic and astonishing the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was someone great. 
8:10 To whom they were taking-heed, from the little to the great, saying, This one is the power of God, the Great. 
8:11 Now they were taking-heed to him because he <i>had</i> astonished them with his magic for a considerable time. 
8:12 But when they believed Philip proclaiming the good-news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being immersed*, both men and women. 
8:13 Now Simon himself also believed and had been immersed*, <i>and</i> was persevering with Philip. And viewing signs and great miracles <i>which were</i> happening, he was being astonished.</p>
<p>8:14 Now when* the apostles who were in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them; 
8:15 who, having come down, prayed concerning them <i>so</i> *that they might receive the Holy Spirit. 
8:16 For* he had not yet fallen upon any of them, but they were* only immersed* into the name of Jesus Christ. 
8:17 Then they were laying their hands upon them and they were receiving the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>8:18 But when* Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them monies, 
8:19 saying, Give to me also this authority, in order that I may lay my hands on whomever, <i>and</i> he may receive <i>the</i> Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>8:20 But Peter said to him, May your silver together with you be <i>sent</i> into destruction, because you have thought to procure the gift of God through monies! 
8:21 You have neither part nor inheritance in this word, for* your heart is not straight in God’s sight. 
8:22 Therefore repent from this, your malice, and beseech God; if, then, the deliberation of your heart will be forgiven you. 
8:23 For* I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of unrighteousness.</p>
<p>8:24 But Simon answered and said, You*, beseech on my behalf to the Lord, *that none of the things which you* have spoken may come upon me.</p>
<br>
<p>8:25 Therefore indeed, having thoroughly testified and having spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem and proclaimed the good-news to many villages of the Samaritans.</p>
<br>
<p>{Summer 37 AD. Road from Jerusalem to Gaza.}</p>
<p>8:26 But a messenger of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Stand up and travel toward the midday <i>sun</i> to the road which is going down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desolate <i>road</i>. 
8:27 And he stood up and traveled <i>away</i>.</p>
<p>And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch, (a sovereign under Candace, the queen of Ethiopia, who was <i>in charge</i> over all her treasure), who had come to Jerusalem to worship, 
8:28 who was returning and sitting in his chariot and was reading the prophet Isaiah. 
8:29 Now the Spirit said to Philip, <b>Go near and join yourself to this chariot.</b></p>
<br>
<p>{Examples of those who were saved in the New Testament: Acts 2:14-42; 8:5-13; 8:30-39; 9:17-18, 22:6-16, 26:12-18; 10:34-48; 16:13-15; 16:25-34; 18:8; 19:1-7.}</p>
<p>8:30 Now Philip running up to him, heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and said, Do you know then what you are reading?</p>
<p>8:31 But he said, For* how am I able, if someone does not guide me? And he pleaded with Philip to come up and sit together with him. 
8:32 Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this: ‘He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb in front of his shearer is voiceless, thus he does not open his mouth. 
8:33 His judgment was taken away in his humbleness. But who will describe his generation? Because his life is taken from the earth.’ {Isa 53:7, 8} 
8:34 But Philip answered and said to the eunuch, I am beseeching you, concerning whom is the prophet speaking <i>about in</i> this? <i>Is he speaking</i> concerning himself or concerning some other <i>person</i>?</p>
<p>8:35 Now Philip opened his mouth and beginning from this Scripture, proclaimed to him Jesus. 
8:36 Now as they were traveling down the road, they came to a certain water, and the eunuch says, Behold, <i>here is</i> water; what is preventing me <i>from</i> being immersed*? {T} 
8:37 Now Philip said, If you believe from all your heart, it is permitted.</p>
<p>But he answered and said I believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God.</p>
<p>8:38 Now he commanded the chariot to stand <i>still</i> and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he immersed* him. 
8:39 Now when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord seized Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, for* he was traveling <i>on</i> his way rejoicing.</p>
<p>8:40 But Philip was found in Azotus and going through, he was proclaiming the good-news to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.</p>

<h3>Acts 9</h3>
<p>{Summer AD 37. Damascus. Saul is around 35 years old. Herod Antipas deposed. Herod Agrippa 1st king, 5th ruler of Galilee &amp; Perea.}</p>
<p>9:1 But Saul, still breathing threatening and murder toward the disciples of the Lord, having come to the high-priest, 
9:2 asked from him letters *for Damascus to the synagogues, *that if he found some who were of the Way, both men and women, having been bound, he might lead <i>them</i> to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>9:3 But it happened while* he traveled; <i>when</i> he drew near to Damascus; suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him, 
9:4 and he fell upon the earth and heard a voice saying to him, <b>Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?</b></p>
<p>9:5 But he said, Who are you, Lord?</p>
<p>But the Lord said, <b>I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</b> {T} <i><b>It is hard for you to kick the cattle-prods.</b></i></p>
<p>9:6 <i>And trembling and amazed, he said, What do you wish me to do?</i></p>
<p><i>And the Lord said to him,</i> <b>But stand up and enter into the city and it will be told to you what it is essential <i>for</i> you to do.</b></p>
<p>9:7 But the men traveling together with him stood speechless, indeed hearing the voice, but viewing no one. 
9:8 Now Saul was raised from the earth, and when* his eyes had been opened, he was seeing nothing, but leading him by the hand, they led <i>him</i> into Damascus. 
9:9 And he was <i>there</i> three days not seeing and did neither eat nor drink.</p>
<br>
<p>9:10 Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus, Ananias by name, and the Lord said to him in a vision, <b>Ananias</b>.</p>
<p>And he said, Behold, I <i>am here</i>, Lord.</p>
<p>9:11 Now the Lord <i>said</i> to him, <b>Stand up and travel to the lane which is called Straight and seek a man from Tarsus, Saul by name, in the house of Judas; for* behold, he is praying;</b> 
9:12 <b>and he has seen in a vision a man, Ananias by name, coming in and laying a hand on him, *that he might recover his sight</b>.</p>
<p>9:13 But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man <i>and</i> how-much evil he did to your holy-ones in Jerusalem, 
9:14 and he has authority from the high-priests here to bind all who are calling upon your name.</p>
<p>9:15 But the Lord said to him, <b>Travel, because this one is a chosen vessel for me, to bear my name in the sight of the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;</b> 
9:16 <b>for* I will show him how-much it is essential for him to suffer on behalf of my name.</b></p>

<p>9:17 Now Ananias went away and entered into the house, and laying his hands upon him said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road <i>on</i> which you were coming, has sent me, *that you may recover your sight and may be filled with the Holy Spirit. 
9:18 And immediately <i>things</i> like scales fell from his eyes and he recovered his sight, and he stood up and was immersed*; 
9:19 and he took nourishment and was strengthened.</p>
<br>
<p>Now Saul happened <i>to be</i> with the disciples who were in Damascus <i>for</i> some days. 
9:20 And immediately in the synagogues he was preaching the Christ, that he is the Son of God. 
9:21 Now all who heard him were being astonished and were saying, Is this not the one who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who are calling upon this name? And he has come here *for this <i>purpose</i>, that* he might lead them who have been bound in front of the high-priests. 
9:22 But Saul was being empowered more and was confusing the Jews who are dwelling in Damascus, lecturing that this <i>Jesus</i> is the Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>9:23 Now as a considerable <i>number of</i> days were being fulfilled, the Jews counseled together to assassinate him; 
9:24 but their pact became known to Saul. And they were guarding the gates both day and night *that they might assassinate him. 
9:25 But the disciples took him by night and dropped him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.</p>

<p>{Sept. 39 AD. Jerusalem. Paul’s first visit there.}</p>
<p>9:26 Now having come into Jerusalem, he was attempting to join himself to the disciples, and all were fearing him, not believing that he was a disciple. 
9:27 But Barnabas took him and led <i>him</i> to the apostles, and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road and that he had spoken to him and how in Damascus he had spoke boldly in the name of Lord Jesus. 
9:28 And he was traveling into <i>it</i>, with them at Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. 
9:29 And he both was speaking and was debating together with the Grecian Jews, but they were undertaking <i>the task</i> to assassinate him.</p>
<p>{40-43 AD Paul in Tarsus &amp; Cilicia.}</p>
<p>9:30 Now when* the brethren fully knew it, they brought* him down to Caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus.</p>
<p>9:31 Therefore indeed, <i>all</i> the congregations* throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace. They were multiplying, having been built up, and having conducted-themselves in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>{40 AD. Lydda &amp; Joppa. Herod Antipas banished.}</p>
<p>9:32 Now it happened, Peter, going through all <i>the regions</i>, also came down to the holy-ones, those who dwell <i>at</i> Lydda. 
9:33 Now he found a certain man there, Aeneas by name, who was paralyzed <i>and had been</i> laying in his pallet <i>for</i> eight years. 
9:34 And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Stand up and spread <i>your bed</i> for yourself. And immediately he stood up. 
9:35 And all who dwelt <i>at</i> Lydda, and in Sharon, saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>9:36 Now there was a certain disciple in Joppa, Tabitha by name, which being translated, is called Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and of charity, which she was doing. 
9:37 Now it happened in those days, she, having been sick, died. Having bathed her, they laid her in an upstairs room. 
9:38 Now Lydda was near to Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was in it, sent for him, encouraging <i>him</i> not to hesitate to come to them. 
9:39 Now having stood <i>up</i>, Peter went together with them, those who had come <i>to him, and</i> they led him into the upstairs room. And all the widows stood by him weeping and showing the tunics and garments; as many as Dorcas was making*, when* she was with them. 
9:40 But when* Peter cast them all outside <i>and</i> placed his knees <i>on the floor</i>, he prayed, and having turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, rise* up. And she opened her eyes, and when* she saw Peter, she sat up. 
9:41 Now he gave her his hand and stood her <i>up</i>, and summoning the holy-ones and widows, he presented her <i>as</i> living. 
9:42 Now it became known throughout the whole of Joppa and many believed on the Lord. 
9:43 Now it happened, that he remained a considerable <i>number of</i> days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.</p>
<h3>Acts 10</h3>
<p>{40 AD. Caesarea.}</p>
<p>10:1 Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of the cohort {600 soldiers} called the Italian <i>cohort,</i> 
10:2 a devout man, who feared God together with all his house and doing much charity for the people and always besought of God. 
10:3 He saw openly in a vision, <i>at</i> approximately the ninth hour {i.e. 
3:00 PM} of the day, a messenger of God coming forth to him and saying to him, Cornelius. 
10:4 But having stared at him and becoming fearful, he said, What is it, Lord?</p>
<p>But he said to him, Your prayers and your charity have gone up *for a memorial in God’s sight. 
10:5 And now send men to Joppa and send for Simon, who is surnamed Peter. 
10:6 He is lodging with a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is beside <i>the</i> sea. {T} <i>He will tell you something that is essential for you to do.</i> 
10:7 Now as the messenger, the one <i>who had been</i> speaking to Cornelius, went away, he summoned two of his domestic <i>servants</i> and a devout soldier of those who are persevering with him; 
10:8 and having described all <i>these</i> things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</p>
<br>
<p>{40 AD. Joppa.}</p>
<p>10:9 Now on the next-day, while* those <i>men</i> were traveling and drawing near to the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, around the sixth hour {i.e. Noon}. 
10:10 Now he became very hungry and wished to eat, but when* those <i>men</i> were preparing <i>the food</i>, a trance fell upon him. 
10:11 And he views the heaven having opened and a certain vessel coming down, like a great sheet having been bound and being dropped down by four edges upon the earth; 
10:12 in which were* all <i>kinds of</i> four footed mammals and beasts and reptiles of the earth and birds of the heaven. 
10:13 And there came* a voice to him, <b>Stand up Peter; sacrifice and eat.</b></p>
<p>10:14 But Peter said, Not-so, Lord, because I have never* eaten anything, common or unclean.</p>
<p>10:15 And a voice <i>came</i> to him again the second-time, <b>What God has cleansed, you, do not make common.</b> 
10:16 But this happened three-times and again the vessel was received up into heaven.</p>
<p>10:17 Now as Peter was perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might be. And behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon’s house, stood by the gate, 
10:18 and having summoned <i>them</i>, they were inquiring if Simon, who was surnamed Peter, is lodged here.</p>
<p>10:19 But when* Peter was contemplating concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, <b>Behold, men are seeking you.</b> 
10:20 <b>But <i>now</i>, stand up and go down and travel together with them, judging nothing, because I have sent them.</b></p>
<p>10:21 Now Peter went down to the men {T} <i>who were sent from Cornelius to him</i> and said, Behold, I am he whom you* are seeking. What is the cause through which you* are here?</p>
<p>10:22 Now they said, Cornelius a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God and is well testified of by the whole nation of the Jews, was divinely-warned by a holy messenger to send for you to <i>come to</i> his house and to hear words from you. 
10:23 So he invited them in and lodged them.</p>
<br>
<p>{40 AD. Caesarea.}</p>
<p>Now on the next-day Peter came out and went together with them and some of the brethren from Joppa went together with him. 
10:24 And on the next-day they entered into Caesarea. Now Cornelius was expecting them, having called together his relatives and his intimate friends. 
10:25 Now it happened, as Peter entered in, Cornelius, having met him, and having fallen down upon <i>his</i> feet, worshiped <i>him</i>. 
10:26 But Peter lifted him up, saying, Stand up; I myself am also a man. 
10:27 And <i>while</i> conversing together with him, he entered and finds many have gathered together. 
10:28 And he said to them, You* yourselves know how it is an illegal thing for a man <i>who is</i> a Jew to join himself or to come to a heathen, and <i>yet</i> God showed to me to call* no man common or unclean. 
10:29 Hence also, undeniably I came, having been sent for. Therefore I am inquiring, for what reason did you* send for me?</p>
<br>
<p>10:30 And Cornelius said, Four days till this hour, I was fasting and praying in the ninth hour {i.e. 
3:00 PM} in my house, and behold, a man stood in my sight in bright apparel, 
10:31 and says, Cornelius, your prayer is heard and your charity is remembered in God’s sight. 
10:32 Therefore send to Joppa, and call to you Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he is lodged in the house of Simon, a tanner, by <i>the</i> sea. When* he comes; he will speak to you. 
10:33 Therefore, promptly I sent for you, and having come, you did well. Therefore, now we are all here in God’s sight, to hear all things which have been commanded to you from God.</p>
<br>
<p>{Examples of those who were saved in the New Testament: Acts 2:14-42; 8:5-13; 8:30-39; 9:17-18, 22:6-16, 26:12-18; 10:34-48; 16:13-15; 16:25-34; 18:8; 19:1-7.}</p>
<p>10:34 Now Peter opened his mouth and said, In truth, I comprehended that God is not one who shows-partiality 
10:35 but in every nation, he who fears him and is working righteousness, is acceptable to him. 
10:36 The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming the good-news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all). 
10:37 You* know, the word <i>concerning Jesus</i> which happened throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the immersion* that John preached. 
10:38 Jesus who <i>was</i> from Nazareth; how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power; who went through<i>out the land</i> working good* and healing all who were oppressed by the Devil, because God was with him. 
10:39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the region of the Jews and in Jerusalem– whom they also assassinated, hanging <i>him</i> upon a tree. 
10:40 God raised him <i>up on</i> the third day and gave him to become manifest, 
10:41 not to all the people, but to witnesses that have been assigned before by God, <i>even</i> to us, who ate and drank together with him after he rose* up from the dead. 
10:42 And he commanded us to preach to the people and to thoroughly testify that this is he who has been determined by God, Judge of the living and the dead. 
10:43 To him all the prophets are testifying, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive forgiveness of sins.</p>
<br>
<p>10:44 <i>While</i> Peter is still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word. 
10:45 And the believing <i>ones</i> out of the circumcision, were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had also been poured out upon the Gentiles. 
10:46 For* they were hearing them speak in <i>foreign</i> languages and extolling God.</p>
<p>Then Peter answered, 
10:47 Is anyone able to forbid the water, that these <i>people</i> should not be immersed*, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we? 
10:48 And he commanded them to be immersed* in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they requested him to remain a some days.</p>
<br>
<h3>Acts 11</h3>
<p>11:1 Now the apostles and the brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also accepted the word of God. 
11:2 And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision were arguing with him, 
11:3 saying, You entered to men having an uncircumcised <i>state</i> and ate together with them.</p>
<p>11:4 But Peter began and was expounding <i>the matter</i> to them afterwards, saying, 
11:5 I was in the city of Joppa praying and I saw a vision <i>while</i> in a trance, a certain vessel coming down, like a great sheet being dropped down from heaven by four edges, and it came to me. 
11:6 In which, I was considering, having stared into it, and I saw the four footed mammals of the earth and <i>other</i> beasts and reptiles and birds of the heaven.</p>
<p>11:7 Now I heard a voice saying to me, <b>Stand up Peter; sacrifice and eat</b>.</p>
<p>11:8 But I said, Not-so, Lord, because anything common or unclean has never* entered into my mouth.</p>
<p>11:9 But a voice answered me the second-time from heaven, <b>What God has cleansed, you, do not make common.</b> 
11:10 Now this happened three-times and all were pulled up again into heaven. 
11:11 And behold, promptly three men stood by the house in which we were, having been sent from Caesarea to me. 
11:12 But the Spirit told me to go together with them, making no distinction. Now these six brethren also came together with me, and we entered into the man’s house. 
11:13 And he reported to us how he had seen the messenger standing in his house and saying to him, Send men to Joppa and send for Simon, whose surname is Peter; 
11:14 who will speak <i>the</i> words to you in which you will be saved, you and all your house. 
11:15 Now while<b>*</b> I was beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just-like upon us in <i>the</i> beginning. 
11:16 Now I remembered the declaration of the Lord, how he said, <b>John indeed immersed* in water, but you* will be immersed* in the Holy Spirit.</b> 
11:17 Therefore, if God gave to them the equal gift like <i>he</i> also <i>did</i> to us when* we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, now who was I, that I am able to forbid God? 
11:18 But having heard these things, they were quiet and glorifying God, saying, Consequently*, God has also given repentance toward life to the Gentiles.</p>
<br>
<p>{40-41 AD. Antioch, Phoenicia, Cyprus, etc. The Good-news extended to all the Gentiles. Jan., 41 AD Claudius becomes Emperor.}</p>
<p>11:19 Therefore indeed, those who were dispersed from the affliction which happened upon Stephen, went to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except only to <i>the</i> Jews. 
11:20 Now there were some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, having come into Antioch, were also speaking to the Grecian Jews, proclaiming the Lord Jesus. 
11:21 And the hand of the Lord was with them and a large number who believed turned to the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>{42 AD. Jerusalem to Antioch. Herod Agrippa receives kingdom of Judea &amp; Samaria.}</p>
<p>11:22 Now the word concerning them was heard in the ears of the congregation* which <i>was</i> in Jerusalem. And they sent forth Barnabas to Antioch; 
11:23 who, having come and having seen the grace of God, rejoiced and was encouraging all with purpose of heart to remain with the Lord, 
11:24 because he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and a considerable crowd was added to the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>{43-44 AD. Claudius goes to Britain.}</p>
<p>11:25 Now Barnabas went forth to Tarsus to seek Saul; 
11:26 and having found him, he led him to Antioch. Now it happened, they were gathered together with <i>him</i> in the congregation* a whole year and he taught a considerable crowd, and the disciples were first divinely-called Christians, in Antioch.</p>
<br>
<p>11:27 Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
11:28 Now there stood up one of them, Agabus by name, and he signified through the Spirit <i>that</i> a great famine is about to be upon the whole inhabited-earth; which also happened in the days of Claudius Caesar. {47 A.D.} 
11:29 Now the disciples, according to what was anyone’s prosperity, each of them determined to send a service <i>of relief</i> to the brethren dwelling in Judea; 
11:30 which they also did, having sent it to the elders through the hand<i>s</i> of Barnabas and Saul.</p>
<h3>Acts 12</h3>
<p>{March 44 AD. Jerusalem.}</p>
<p>12:1 Now throughout that time, Herod the king put his hands upon <i>them</i> to mistreat some from the congregation*. 
12:2 Now he assassinated James the brother of John with a sword. {April 44 AD.} 
12:3 And having seen that it was pleasing to the Jews, he also proceeded to take Peter. (And these were the days of unleavened bread.) 
12:4 He also arrested him, <i>and</i> he placed him in prison and gave him to four companies of four soldiers to guard him; planning to bring* him up to the people after the Passover. 
12:5 Therefore indeed, Peter was being kept in the prison, but intense prayer was happening by the congregation* to God on his behalf. 
12:6 But when Herod was about to lead him out, in that same night Peter had fallen-asleep between two soldiers, having been bound with two chains, and guards before the door were guarding the prison. 
12:7 And behold, a messenger of the Lord stood by him and a light shined in the cell and he struck Peter on the ribs and lifted him up, saying, Stand up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. 
12:8 And the messenger said to him, Gird yourself and tie on your sandals. Now he did so. And he says to him, Put your garment around you and follow me. 
12:9 And he went out and was following him, and he did not know that this was true, which was happening through the messenger, but he was thinking that he was seeing a vision. 
12:10 Now having gone through <i>the</i> first and second prison, they came to the iron gate that brings <i>them</i> into the city; which opened by itself for them, and they went out and went forward one lane, and immediately the messenger withdrew from him.</p>
<p>12:11 And Peter, having come* to himself, said, Now I truly know, that the Lord has sent forth his messenger and liberated me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. 
12:12 And being conscious of <i>it</i>, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where a considerable <i>number</i> was accumulating together and <i>were</i> praying. 
12:13 Now when* Peter knocked <i>at</i> the door of the gate, a maidservant, Rhoda by name, came to listen <i>to who was there</i>. 
12:14 And when* she recognized the voice of Peter, she did not open the gate from joy, but ran in and reported Peter to be standing before the gate.</p>
<p>12:15 But they said to her, You are mad.</p>
<p>But she was stoutly affirming that it was so.</p>
<p>And they were saying, It is his messenger.</p>
<p>12:16 But Peter was remaining <i>and kept</i> knocking. Now having opened <i>the door</i>, they saw him and were astonished. 
12:17 But he, having beckoned to them with the hand to be silent, described to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. Now he said, Report these things to James and to the brethren. And he came out and traveled to a different place. 
12:18 When* it became day, there was not <i>just</i> a small disturbance among the soldiers, <i>as to</i> what then had become of Peter. 
12:19 Now when* Herod sought him and did not find him, he examined the guards and commanded <i>them</i> to be led away <i>for execution</i>. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea and was staying there.</p>
<br>
<p>{Around May 44 AD. Caesarea. Herod Agrippa dies. Palestine reunited to Rome.}</p>
<p>12:20 Now Herod was quarreling furiously with those from Tyre and Sidon. But they were united here before him, and were asking for peace, and they persuaded Blastus who <i>was</i> over the king’s bedroom. <i>This was done</i> because their region is nourished from the king’s <i>region</i>. 
12:21 Now upon an appointed day, Herod dressed himself in royal apparel, and sat upon the judicial-seat and was <i>publicly</i> addressing them. 
12:22 But the public was shouting out, <i>saying</i>, <i>This is</i> the voice of a god and not of a man! 
12:23 But instantly a messenger of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God <i>the</i> glory and he expired, having become maggot-eaten.</p>
<br>
<p>12:24 But the word of God was growing and being multiplied.</p>
<br>
<p>{Spring 44 AD. Antioch to Jerusalem back to Antioch (Acts 11:30), sending relief.}</p>
<p>12:25 Now Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem, having fulfilled their service <i>and</i> having taken together with them John whose surname was Mark.</p>
<h3>Acts 13</h3>
<p>{45-48 AD. Asia Minor. Paul’s first missionary journey from Antioch to Perga, Cyprus, Antioch in Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe and back to Antioch in Syria.}</p>
<p>13:1 Now there were some prophets and teachers in the congregation* which was in Antioch: both Barnabas, and Symeon who was called Niger, and Lucius from Cyrene, and Manaen, a foster-brother of Herod the Tetrarch, and Saul. 
13:2 Now <i>while</i> ministering* to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, <b>Separate* Barnabas and Saul for me, *for the work to which I have called them.</b> 
13:3 Then having fasted and prayed and having laid their hands on them, they dismissed them.</p>
<br>
<p>13:4 Therefore indeed, these men, having been sent out by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and sailed to Cyprus from there. 
13:5 And when* they happened <i>to be</i> in Salamis, they were proclaiming the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and they also had John, an attendant.</p>
<p>13:6 Now having gone through the island up to Paphos, they found a certain magician, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Son of Joshua; 
13:7 who was together with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This one sought to hear the word of God, having called to him Barnabas and Saul. 
13:8 But Elymas the magician (for* so is his name by translation) was standing against them, seeking to pervert the proconsul away from the faith. 
13:9 But Saul, who is also <i>called</i> Paul, having been filled with the Holy Spirit, stared toward him, 
13:10 <i>and</i> said, O full of all treachery and all villainy, you son of the Devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord? 
13:11 And now, behold, the hand of <i>the</i> Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and <i>will</i> not see the sun till <i>the next</i> season. Now instantly dimness and darkness fell upon him, and going around, he was seeking <i>someone</i> to lead <i>him</i> by the hand. 
13:12 Then the proconsul believed, having seen what <i>had</i> happened, being astounded by the teaching of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>13:13 Now Paul, <i>with</i> those around him, having set-sail from Paphos, came to Perga in Pamphylia, and John having departed from them, returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>13:14 But they, going through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia {Asia Minor.}, and having entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, they sat down. 
13:15 Now after the public-reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent for them, saying, Brethren, if there is a word of encouragement to the people in you*, speak <i>it</i>.</p>
<p>13:16 Now when* Paul stood up and beckoned with the hand, he said,</p>
<p>Men, Israelites, and you* who fear God, listen: 
13:17 The God of this people chose our fathers and exalted the people in their foreign residency, in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm he led them forth out of it. 
13:18 And he tolerated their mannerisms in the wilderness <i>for</i> approximately the time of forty years. 
13:19 And having demolished seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave to them their land for an inheritance, <i>for</i> approximately four hundred and fifty years. 
13:20 And he gave <i>them</i> judges after these things until Samuel the prophet. 
13:21 And from thereon, they asked for a king. And God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, <i>for</i> forty years. 
13:22 And having removed him, he lifted <i>up</i> David to be their king; to whom he also testified and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man according to my own heart, who will do all my will.</p>
<p>13:23 God brought* salvation from the seed of this <i>man David,</i> according to a promise to Israel, 
13:24 when* John preached beforehand <i>the</i> immersion* of repentance to Israel, before his face <i>and before</i> his entrance. 
13:25 Now as John was fulfilling his course, he was saying, Who do you* perceive that I am? I am not <i>he</i>. But behold, there is one coming after me, the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to loosen. 
13:26 Brethren, sons from the race of Abraham and those among you* who fear God, to us is sent forth the word of this salvation. 
13:27 For* those dwelling in Jerusalem and their rulers who were ignorant of him, and the voices of the prophets which are read on every Sabbath, they fulfilled <i>them by</i> having judged <i>him to death.</i> 
13:28 And <i>though</i> no one found a crime <i>worthy</i> of death <i>in him</i>, they <i>still</i> asked Pilate to assassinate him. 
13:29 Now as they completed all things that have been written concerning him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb. 
13:30 But God raised him <i>up</i> from the dead; 
13:31 and he was seen for many days by those who came up together with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people. 
13:32 And we proclaim to you* the good-news of the promise which came* to the fathers, that God has fulfilled this for us, their children, in that he raised* up Jesus; 
13:33 as it has also been written in the second Psalm, ‘You are my Son; I have fathered you today.’ {Psa 2:7} 
13:34 Now that he raised* him up from the dead, no longer being about to return to decay, he has spoken thus, I will give you* the faithful <i>and</i> holy things of David. 
13:35 Hence, he also says in another psalm, ‘You will not give your Holy One to see decay.’ {Psa 16:10} 
13:36 For* indeed David, having attended to the counsel of God in his own generation, fell-asleep and was added to his fathers and saw decay; 
13:37 but he whom God raised <i>up</i> saw no decay. 
13:38 Therefore brethren, let it be known to you* that forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you* through this one; 
13:39 and in him, everyone who believes is justified from all things, from which you* were not able to be justified by the Law of Moses. 
13:40 Therefore beware, that what has been spoken in the prophets might not come upon you*: 
13:41 ‘You* despisers, behold and marvel and disappear, because I am working a work in your* days, <i>a work</i> which you* may never* believe, <i>even</i> if someone describes it to you*.’ {Hab. 1:5}</p>
<p>13:42 But when* the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles were pleading with <i>him</i> that <i>these</i> words might be spoken to them at the ensuing Sabbath. 
13:43 Now when* the synagogue had been dissolved, many of the Jews and the pious Jewish-converts followed Paul and Barnabas; who speaking <i>to them</i>, they were persuading them to remain in the grace of God.</p>
<p>13:44 Now the coming Sabbath, almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God. 
13:45 But the Jews, having seen the crowds, were filled <i>up</i> from jealousy, and were contradicting the things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>13:46 But Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you*. But since you* are thrusting it from yourselves and are judging yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles. 
13:47 For* so the Lord has commanded us, <i>saying</i>, ‘I have placed you to <i>be</i> a light of the Gentiles, that you should be *for salvation to the outermost <i>parts</i> of the earth.’ {Isa 42:6}</p>
<p>13:48 And when* the Gentiles heard this, they were rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointing <i>themselves</i> toward everlasting life, believed. 
13:49 Now the word of the Lord was being carried through the whole region.</p>
<p>13:50 But the Jews spurred on the pious and prominent women and the foremost ones of the city, and aroused a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders. 
13:51 But they shook-off the dirt of their feet against them and came to Iconium. 
13:52 Now the disciples were being filled from joy and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h3>Acts 14</h3>
<p>14:1 Now it happened in Iconium according to the same thing, they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews and spoke, so-that a large multitude believed, both from the Jews and Greeks. 
14:2 But the disobedient Jews aroused and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brethren. 
14:3 Therefore, they indeed stayed a considerable time <i>there,</i> speaking boldly in the Lord, (him testifying to the word of his grace), giving signs and wonders to happen through their hands. 
14:4 But the multitude of the city was split-apart, and some were together with the Jews and some together with the apostles. 
14:5 Now as it became an impulse <i>of</i> both of the Gentiles and of the Jews, together with their rulers, to abuse them and to stone them, 
14:6 they fled for refuge, being conscious of it, to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the region around <i>them</i>. 
14:7 And they were proclaiming the good-news there.</p>
<br>
<p>14:8 And <i>there was</i> a certain man, who was sitting in Lystra, being* powerless in his feet, being lame from his mother’s womb, who had never* walked. 
14:9 This one heard Paul speaking, who, having stared at him and seeing that he had faith to be cured, 
14:10 said with a loud voice, Stand correctly upon your feet. And he was leaping up and walking.</p>
<p>14:11 Now when* the crowd saw what Paul did, they lifted up their voice, saying in Lycaonian, The gods have come down to us who are similar to men. 
14:12 And indeed, they were calling Barnabas, Zeus; but Paul, Hermes, since he was the leader of the speech. 
14:13 Now the priest of Zeus, whose <i>temple</i> was before their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and were wishing to sacrifice <i>them</i> together with the crowds.</p>
<p>14:14 But when* the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they ripped their garments and dashed into the crowd, crying out 
14:15 and saying, Men! Why are you* doing these things? We are also human, of like-feelings with you* <i>and are</i> proclaiming to you* good-news to turn <i>you</i>* away from these futile things to the living God, who made* the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things in them; 
14:16 who permitted all the nations in the generations which have gone-by, to conduct-themselves in their own ways. 
14:17 Although he did not leave himself unwitnessed, <i>by</i> doing good, giving rainfalls and fruitful seasons to us from heaven, filling our hearts with nourishment and joy. 
14:18 And saying these things, with difficulty they made the crowds cease from sacrificing to us.</p>
<br>
<p>14:19 But Jews came upon <i>us there</i> from Antioch and Iconium and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul, and were dragging him outside the city, supposing him to have died. 
14:20 But the disciples surrounded him, <i>and</i> he rose* up and entered into the city, and he went forth on the next-day together with Barnabas to Derbe. 
14:21 And having proclaimed the good-news to that city, and having made a considerable <i>number of</i> disciples, they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch, 
14:22 further strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to remain in the faith and that it is essential for us through many afflictions to enter into the kingdom of God. 
14:23 Now having assigned elders to them in every congregation*, and when* they had prayed with fastings, they consigned them to the Lord, in whom they had believed.</p>
<p>14:24 And having gone through Pisidia and they came to Pamphylia. 
14:25 And having spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia; 
14:26 and they sailed from there to Antioch, from where they were given to the grace of God, *for the work which they had fulfilled.</p>
<br>
<p>{48-50 AD. Antioch. April 5, 49 AD A skirmish between Roman troops &amp; the Jews at the Passover.}</p>
<p>14:27 Now having come and having gathered the congregation* together, they reported how-much God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. 
14:28 Now they were staying there together with the disciples a time; not <i>just</i> a few.</p>
<h3>Acts 15</h3>
<p>{50 AD. Jerusalem. Caractacus of Britain conquered and sent to Rome.}</p>
<p>15:1 And some, having come down from Judea, were teaching the brethren, <i>saying,</i> If you* are not circumcised after the custom of Moses, you* are unable to be saved. 
15:2 Therefore, when* it happened, (not <i>just</i> a small dissension and debate by Paul and Barnabas with them), <i>the brethren</i> appointed Paul and Barnabas, and some others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning this debate.</p>
<br>
<p>15:3 Therefore indeed, being sent onward by the congregation*, they were going through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the turning <i>to God</i> of the Gentiles, and they were producing great joy in all the brethren. 
15:4 Now having come to Jerusalem, they were accepted by the congregation*, and the apostles and the elders, and they reported how-much God did with them. 
15:5 But there rose up some of the sect of the Pharisees who have believed, saying, It is essential to circumcise them and to command them to keep the Law of Moses. {Gal. 2:1}</p>
<br>
<p>15:6 Now the apostles and the elders were gathered together to see concerning this matter {Greek: word. Or speech.}. 
15:7 Now after much debate had happened, Peter standing up, said to them, Brethren, you* know that from <i>the</i> good days of old, God was choosing among us, that through my mouth, the Gentiles should hear the word of the good-news and believe. 
15:8 And God, <i>the</i> knower of hearts, testifies of them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just-as <i>he</i> also <i>did</i> to us; 
15:9 and he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts in the faith. 
15:10 Therefore now, why are you* testing God, <i>that is,</i> to place a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers, nor we, were strong-enough to bear? 
15:11 But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of <i>the</i> Lord Jesus, and they also, according to the <i>same</i> manner.</p>
<br>
<p>15:12 Now all the multitude was silent, and they were hearing Barnabas and Paul describing how-much God did, <i>in</i> signs and wonders, among the Gentiles through them.</p>
<p>15:13 Now after they were silent, James answered, saying, Brethren, hear me. 
15:14 Symeon has described, just-as <i>beforehand</i>, <i>how</i> God visited the nations first, to take out of them a people for his name. 
15:15 And the words of the prophets agree together with this; just-as it has been written, 
15:16 ‘I will turn back after these things, and I will build the tabernacle of David again, which has fallen. And I will build its ruins again. And I will straighten it, 
15:17 *that the rest of men may seek out the Lord, and all the nations, upon whom my name has been called, says the Lord who is doing all these things,’ {Amos 9:11, 12} 
15:18 (known to God from the age<i>s,</i> are all his works.)</p>
<p>15:19 Hence, I judge not to trouble those who are turning to God from among the Gentiles; 
15:20 but to inform them by letter: to abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood. 
15:21 For* Moses has those who preach him in every city, from ancient generations, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.</p>
<br>
<p>15:22 Then it seemed <i>good</i> to the apostles and the elders, together with the whole congregation*, to send chosen men from them<i>selves</i>: Judas surnamed Barsabbas and Silas; leading men among the brethren, to Antioch together with Paul and Barnabas. {Gal. 2:13-15}</p>
<p>15:23 They wrote through their hand these things:</p>
<br>
<p>The apostles and the elders and brethren, to the brethren who <i>are</i> from the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia. Hail <i>to you</i>!</p>
<p>15:24 Since we have heard that some who went out from us have disturbed you* with words, upsetting your* souls; saying <i>you</i>* <i>must</i> be circumcised and to keep the law, to whom we ordered no <i>such thing</i>; 
15:25 it seemed <i>good</i> to us, having become united, to choose out men and send them to you* together with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 
15:26 men who have given up their lives on behalf of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
15:27 Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will also report to you* the same things through <i>their</i> speech. 
15:28 For* it seemed <i>good</i> to the Holy Spirit and to us, to place no more burden upon you* except* these necessary things: 
15:29 that you* abstain from idol-sacrifices, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication. Keeping yourselves from these, you* will be practicing well.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
<br>
<p>{James’ letter is written. The beginning of the New Testament letters. There is a very strong possibility the Book of Mark may have been written around this time too or even before.}</p>
<p>15:30 Therefore indeed, when* they were dismissed, they came down to Antioch, and having gathered the multitude together, they gave <i>them</i> the letter. 
15:31 Now having read <i>it</i>, they rejoiced for the encouragement. 
15:32 And Judas and Silas, also being themselves prophets, encouraged the brethren through much speech and further strengthened <i>them</i>. 
15:33 Now after they had spent some time <i>there</i>, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren to those who had sent them forth. 
15:34 {T} <i>But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.</i> 
15:35 But Paul and Barnabas were staying in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord, with many others also.</p>
<br>
<p>{Early in 51 to 53 AD. Antioch into Asia Minor &amp; Europe. Paul’s second missionary journey. Felix was make governor of Judea. Famine at Rome. Jews expelled from Rome.}</p>
<p>15:36 Now after some days Paul said to Barnabas, We should return now <i>and</i> visit the brethren in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord <i>and see</i> how they are holding <i>up.</i> 
15:37 Now Barnabas also planned to take together with them John, who was called Mark. 
15:38 But Paul was not deeming it worthy to take <i>Mark</i> together with them, the one who withdrew away from them from Pamphylia and did not go together with them to the work. 
15:39 Then* there became a sharp-disagreement, so-that they departed from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus; 
15:40 but Paul went forth, having chosen Silas, being given to the grace of the Lord by the brethren. 
15:41 Now he was going through Syria and Cilicia, further strengthening the congregations*.</p>
<h3>Acts 16</h3>
<p>{52 AD. Paul going toward Europe.}</p>
<p>16:1 Now he arrived in Derbe and Lystra, and behold, a certain disciple was there, Timothy by name, the son of a certain Jewess who believed, but his father was a Greek. 
16:2 He was being testified of by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium. 
16:3 This one, Paul wished to go forth together with <i>him</i>, and he took <i>Timothy</i> and circumcised him because of the Jews who were* in those places; for* they all knew that his father was Greek. 
16:4 Now as they were traveling through the cities, they were giving them the decrees, to observe what had been decided by the apostles and the elders who were in Jerusalem. 
16:5 Therefore indeed, the congregations* were being strengthened in the faith, and were abounding in number daily.</p>
<br>
<p>16:6 Now they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia; 
16:7 and having come down to Mysia, they were attempting to travel to Bithyna, and the Spirit did not permit them; 
16:8 and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas. 
16:9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. There was a certain man, a Macedonian, standing, pleading with him and saying, When* you cross over into Macedonia, help us. 
16:10 Now as he saw the vision, we immediately sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord has called us to proclaim the good-news to them.</p>
<br>
<p>{Examples of those who were saved in the New Testament: Acts 2:14-42; 8:5-13; 8:30-39; 9:17-18, 22:6-16, 26:12-18; 10:34-48; 16:13-15; 16:25-34; 18:8; 19:1-7.}</p>
<p>16:11 Therefore setting-sail from Troas, we made a straight route to Samothrace, and the next <i>day</i> to Neapolis; 
16:12 and from there to Philippi, which is <i>the</i> first city of <i>that</i> part of Macedonia, a <i>Roman</i> colony. Now we were staying in this city <i>for</i> some days. 
16:13 And on the Sabbath day, we went forth outside the city by a river side, where we supposed there was a <i>place of</i> prayer, and we sat down and were speaking to the women who had come together. 
16:14 And a certain woman, Lydia by name, was hearing us, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, one who worshiped God, whose heart the Lord opened to take-heed to the things which were spoken by Paul. 
16:15 Now as she and her household were immersed*, she pleaded with us, saying, If you* have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, enter into my house and abide <i>there</i>. And she constrained us.</p>
<br>
<p>{52 AD. Philippi.}</p>
<p>16:16 Now it happened, <i>while</i> traveling to <i>the place of</i> prayer, that a certain maidservant encountered us, having a spirit of divination, who was providing her lords much business by fortune-telling. 
16:17 This <i>maidservant</i> was crying out, following after Paul and us, saying, These men are bondservants of the Highest God, who are proclaiming to us the way of salvation. 
16:18 Now she was doing this for many days. But Paul, being pained, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that same hour.</p>
<br>
<p>16:19 But when* her lords saw that the hope of their business was gone, they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace in front of the rulers. 
16:20 Having brought* them to the magistrates, they said, These men, being* Jews, are disturbing our city, 
16:21 and are proclaiming customs which it is not legal for us to accept, or to do, being Romans. 
16:22 And the crowd stood up together against them, and the magistrates ripped off their garments, and were commanding <i>the sergeants</i> to lash <i>them</i> with rods. 
16:23 And having laid many lashes upon them, they cast them into prison, commanding the jailor to securely guard them. 
16:24 Having received such a command, he cast them into the inner prison and secured their feet in the wood stocks.</p>
<br>
<p>{Examples of those who were saved in the New Testament: Acts 2:14-42; 8:5-13; 8:30-39; 9:17-18, 22:6-16, 26:12-18; 10:34-48; 16:13-15; 16:25-34; 18:8; 19:1-7.}</p>
<p>16:25 But toward midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God and the prisoners were the audience for them; 
16:26 and suddenly there became a great earthquake, so-that the foundations of the prison were shaken and instantly all the doors were opened and everyone’s bonds were lax. 
16:27 But the jailor, having come* out of sleep and seeing the doors of the prison had been open, drew his sword and was about to assassinate himself, supposing the prisoners to have fled. 
16:28 But Paul shouted with a loud voice, saying, Do nothing evil to yourself; for* we are all here.</p>
<p>16:29 Now when* he asked for lights, he dashed in and came* <i>in</i> trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, 
16:30 and led them out, <i>then</i> he said, Lords, what is essential for me to do in order that I might be saved?</p>
<p>16:31 Now they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved, you and your house. 
16:32 And they spoke the word of the Lord to him, to all who were in his house. 
16:33 And having taken them in that <i>same</i> hour of the night, he bathed their lashes, and was instantly immersed*, he and all his <i>household.</i> 
16:34 And he led them up into his house and placed a table <i>before them</i> and was glad, with all his household, <i>all</i> having believed in God.</p>
<br>
<p>16:35 But when* it became day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Release those men.</p>
<p>16:36 Now the jailor reported these words to Paul, <i>saying</i>, The magistrates have sent <i>me</i> that* you* should be released. Therefore come out now and travel in peace.</p>
<p>16:37 But Paul said to them, They have whipped us in public, uncondemned men who are* Romans and have cast us into prison, and are they now casting us out secretly? No, but let them come themselves and let them lead us out.</p>
<p>16:38 Now the sergeants reported these words to the magistrates and they feared, having heard that they were Romans. 
16:39 And having come, they pleaded with them, and having led them out, they asked them to go away from the city.</p>
<p>16:40 Now having come out of the prison and they entered into <i>the house</i> of Lydia and having seen the brethren, they encouraged them and went out.</p>
<h3>Acts 17</h3>
<p>{52 AD. Thessalonica, Berea. Preaching in Macedonia.}</p>
<p>17:1 Now having traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was the synagogue of the Jews. 
17:2 Now according to the custom, Paul entered to them and upon three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures, 
17:3 opening and placing with <i>them</i> that it was essential <i>for</i> the Christ to have suffered and to have risen* up from the dead, and that this Jesus, whom I am proclaiming to you*, is the Christ. 
17:4 And some of them obeyed and adhered to Paul and Silas and a large multitude of the pious Greeks, and not <i>just</i> a few of the foremost women. 
17:5 But the disobedient Jews, took for themselves some evil men from <i>among</i> the market-loafers and having amassed a crowd, the city was in an uproar, and standing against the house of Jason, they were seeking to bring* them to the public. 
17:6 Now when* they did not find them, they were dragging Jason and some brethren in front of the city rulers, crying, These <i>men</i> who have unsettled the inhabited-earth are also here; 
17:7 whom Jason has accepted and all these practice <i>things which are</i> adverse to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is a different king<i>, one called</i>  Jesus. 
17:8 Now hearing these things, they disturbed the crowd and city rulers, 
17:9 and having taken sufficient <i>money</i> from Jason and the rest, they released them.</p>
<br>
<p>17:10 Now the brethren immediately sent out, through the night to Berea, both Paul and Silas, who, having come <i>there</i>, went into the synagogue of the Jews. 
17:11 Now these <i>Jews</i> were more noble <i>than</i> those in Thessalonica, in that they accepted the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily, <i>to see</i> if these things were so. 
17:12 Therefore indeed, many of them believed; also not <i>just</i> a few of the prominent Greek women and of <i>the</i> men. 
17:13 Now as the Jews of Thessalonica knew that the word of God was also proclaimed by Paul in Berea, they also came there, shaking up the crowds. 
17:14 Now the brethren then immediately sent forth Paul to travel <i>as far</i> as to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy were remaining back there.</p>
<br>
<p>{52-53 AD. Paul at Athens, Greece.}</p>
<p>17:15 But those standing over Paul lead him to Athens and receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that* they might come to him as quickly <i>as possible</i>. They went out <i>there</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>17:16 Now <i>while</i> Paul is waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was being irritated in him, <i>while</i> viewing the idol ridden city. 
17:17 Therefore indeed, he was reasoning in <i>the</i> synagogue with the Jews and the pious ones and in the marketplace every day with those who chance upon <i>him</i>. 
17:18 Now also some of the Epicureans and Stoic philosophers were encountering* him. But some were saying, Whatever does this babbler wish to say?</p>
<p>Others <i>said</i>, He seems to be a proclaimer of strange gods {Greek: demons}, because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.</p>
<p>17:19 Now they grabbed him and lead him to the Areopagus, saying, Are we able to know what this new teaching is which is spoken by you? 
17:20 For* you are bringing some surprising things to our ears. Therefore, we plan to know what these things might mean {Greek: wish to be}. 
17:21 (Now all from Athens and the inhabiting strangers had leisure time *for nothing other <i>than</i> to tell and to hear something new.)</p>
<p>17:22 Now Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus and said, Men of Athens, I view that you* are religious according to all things. 
17:23 For* <i>while</i> going through <i>the city</i> and reviewing your* worshiped objects of worship, I also found an altar in which had been written, To An Unknown God. Therefore I am proclaiming to you*, who are ignorant, this one to whom you* are devout. 
17:24 The God that made* the world and all things in it, being* Lord of heaven and earth, he is not dwelling in temples made* with hands; 
17:25 nor is he assisted by men’s hands, <i>as if</i> needy for anything, <i>he</i> himself giving to all, life and breath and in all things. 
17:26 And he made* of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth, having determined <i>their</i> appointed seasons and the borders of their residence; 
17:27 <i>that they are</i> to seek the Lord, if, then, they might grope after him and might find him, although, he is* not far from each one of us. 
17:28 For* we live and move and are {i.e. exist} in him; as some also, according to your* own poets, have said, For* we are also his offspring. {Possible reference to a Stoic poet, Aratus of Soli in Cilicia.} 
17:29 Therefore being the offspring of God, we ought not to suppose that the Divine* is similar to gold or silver or stone, <i>or</i> a carved thing from <i>the</i> craft and the contemplation of man. 
17:30 Therefore indeed, God overlooked the times of ignorance. Hereafter, he is commanding all men everywhere to repent; 
17:31 because he has established a future day in which to judge the inhabited-earth in righteousness by the man whom he has determined <i>beforehand</i>; having provided <i>the</i> faith to all, <i>by</i> having raised* him from the dead.</p>
<p>17:32 Now when* they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some were sneering, but others said, We will hear you concerning this yet again. 
17:33 Thus Paul went out from the midst of them. 
17:34 But some men, joining themselves to him, believed; among whom was also Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman, Damaris by name, and others together with them.</p>
<h3>Acts 18</h3>
<p>{52-53 AD. Paul at Corinth in Greece.}</p>
<p>18:1 After these things, Paul, having departed from Athens, came to Corinth. 
18:2 And he found a certain Jew, Aquila by name, and his wife Priscilla, a man of Pontus by race, who recently had come from Italy, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart out of Rome. He came to them 
18:3 also because he was of the same craft. He was remaining and working with them, for* they were tent makers <i>by</i> trade. 
18:4 Now he was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and was persuading Jews and Greeks.</p>
<br>
<p>18:5 Now as Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was being troubled in spirit, thoroughly testifying to the Jews <i>that</i> Jesus <i>was</i> the Christ. 
18:6 Now when* they themselves <i>did</i> resist <i>us</i> and <i>were</i> blaspheming <i>God</i>, he shook-off his garment and said to them, Your* blood <i>be</i> upon your* own heads. I am clean. From hereafter I will travel to the Gentiles. 
18:7 And he proceeded from there and went into the house of a certain <i>man</i>, Justus by name, one who worshiped God, whose house was adjoining to the synagogue.</p>
<br>
<p>{Examples of those who were saved in the New Testament: Acts 2:14-42; 8:5-13; 8:30-39; 9:17-18, 22:6-16, 26:12-18; 10:34-48; 16:13-15; 16:25-34; 18:8; 19:1-7.}</p>
<p>18:8 Now Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord together with his whole house, and many of the Corinthians hearing, were believing and were being immersed*.</p>
<br>
<p>18:9 Now the Lord said to Paul through a vision in the night, <b>Do not be afraid, but speak <i>out</i> and do not be silent,</b> 
18:10 <b>because I am with you and no one will lay <i>a hand</i> on you to mistreat you, because I have many people in this city.</b> 
18:11 And he stuck-around <i>there</i> a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</p>
<br>
<p>{Paul’s First &amp; Second Letter to the Thessalonians are written.}</p>
<p>18:12 But Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews stood up united against Paul and brought* him in front of the judicial-seat, 
18:13 saying, This one is persuading men to worship God contrary to the law. 
18:14 But when* Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, Therefore if it was indeed some wrongdoing or evil villainy, O you* Jews, I might tolerate you* according to reason. 
18:15 But if there are debates concerning words and names and the law which <i>is</i> according to you*, look to it yourselves; for* I am not willing to be a judge of these things. 
18:16 And he drove them away from the judicial-seat. 
18:17 Now all the Greeks grabbed Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue and were beating him before the judicial-seat. And Gallio was not about to <i>judge</i> anything. 
18:18 But Paul, having remained after this still a considerable <i>number of</i> days, bid farewell to the brethren.</p>
<br>
<p>{September, 54 AD. Paul leaves Europe toward Antioch. Claudius dies; Nero becomes Emperor at Rome in Oct.}</p>
<p><i>Now</i> he sailed away to Syria and together with him <i>was</i> Priscilla and Aquila; having sheared his head in Cenchreae; for* he had a vow. 
18:19 Now they arrived in Ephesus and he left those <i>men</i> there*, but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. 
18:20 Now they <i>were</i> requesting him to remain on <i>for</i> more time, he did not signal-agreement; 
18:21 but bidding farewell to them and saying, It is certainly essential for me to make* the coming feast in Jerusalem but I will revisit you* again, God willing. He set-sail from Ephesus.</p>
<p>18:22 And having come down into Caesarea, he went up and greeted the congregation* and went down into Antioch.</p>
<br>
<p>{Late 54 AD. Paul’s Third Missionary Journey. Josephus, age 16, starts his literary career.}</p>
<p>18:23 And having spent some time <i>there</i>, he came out and went through the region of Galatia and afterwards Phrygia, further strengthening all the disciples.</p>
<br>
<p>18:24 Now a certain Jew, Apollos by name, from Alexandria by birth, a cultured man, arrived in Ephesus, and he was mighty in the Scriptures. 
18:25 This one was instructing <i>people</i> in the way of the Lord, and being zealous in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning the Lord, <i>but</i> only knowing the immersion* of John. 
18:26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when* Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him <i>over</i> to them and expounded to him the way of God more accurately. 
18:27 Now he plan to go into Achaia, <i>but</i> the brethren exhorted him and wrote to the disciples to accept him and when* he came, he supported those much who had believed through the grace; 
18:28 for* he intensely was thoroughly refuting the Jews in public, showing through the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</p>
<h3>Acts 19</h3>
<p>{May, 55 - May 58 AD. Ephesus. Paul’s Letter to the Galatians is written.}</p>
<br>
<p>{Examples of those who were saved in the New Testament: Acts 2:14-42; 8:5-13; 8:30-39; 9:17-18, 22:6-16, 26:12-18; 10:34-48; 16:13-15; 16:25-34; 18:8; 19:1-7.}</p>
<p>19:1 Now it happened, that while* Apollos was in Corinth, Paul, having gone through the upper parts <i>of the region</i>, came to Ephesus and found some disciples. 
19:2 He said to them, Did you* receive the Holy Spirit when* you* believed?</p>
<p>But they said to him, But if there is a Holy Spirit, we did not hear <i>of such</i>.</p>
<p>19:3 And he said to them, Then* into what were you* immersed*?</p>
<p>But they said, Into the immersion* of John.</p>
<p>19:4 But Paul said, John indeed immersed* in <i>the</i> immersion* of repentance, saying to the people that* they should believe in him who is coming after him, that is, in the Christ Jesus. 
19:5 Now having heard this, they were immersed* into the name of the Lord Jesus. 
19:6 And when* Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they were speaking in <i>foreign</i> languages and were prophesying. 
19:7 Now they were in all approximately twelve men.</p>
<br>
<p>19:8 Now he entered into the synagogue and was speaking boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading <i>as to</i> the things concerning the kingdom of God. 
19:9 But as some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way in the sight of the multitude, he withdrew from them and separated* the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of someone <i>named</i> Tyrannus. 
19:10 Now this happened for two years; so-that all those dwelling in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks. 
19:11 And God was doing exceptional miracles through the hands of Paul; 
19:12 so-that even handkerchiefs or aprons from <i>the touch of</i> his skin were carried away to those who were sick and the diseases were set-free from them and the evil spirits went out from them.</p>
<p>19:13 But also, some from the strolling Jews, exorcists, undertook <i>the task</i> to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had the evil spirits, saying, I implore you* <i>by</i> the Jesus whom Paul is preaching. 
19:14 Now there were some (seven sons of Sceva) <i>and</i> a Jew, a high-priest, who <i>were</i> doing this.</p>
<p>19:15 But the evil spirit answered and said to them, I know Jesus, and I know Paul, but who are you*? 
19:16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaped upon them and having mastered, prevailed against them, so-that they fled out of that house, naked and traumatized.</p>
<p>19:17 Now this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, dwelling in Ephesus, and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being extolled. 
19:18 Many of those who had also believed were coming, confessing and proclaiming their practices. 
19:19 Now a considerable <i>number</i> of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and were burning them in the sight of all, and they calculated the prices of them and found it <i>to be</i> fifty thousand pieces of silver. 
19:20 So the word of the Lord was growing and prevailing in dominion.</p>
<br>
<p>19:21 Now as these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in the spirit to travel to Jerusalem, having gone through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, After coming* there, it is essential for me to also see Rome. 
19:22 Now having sent Timothy and Erastus, two of those serving him, into Macedonia, he himself held back in Asia for a <i>short</i> time.</p>
<br>
<p>{56-58 AD. Ephesus. Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians is written.}</p>
<p>19:23 Now it happened throughout that time <i>there was</i> not <i>just</i> a small disturbance concerning the Way. 
19:24 For* a certain <i>man,</i> Demetrius by name, (a silversmith making* <i>miniature</i> silver temples of Artemis), was providing not <i>just</i> a small business to the craftsmen; 
19:25 whom he accumulated together with the <i>other</i> workers of such things and said, Men, you* know that we have our prosperity from this business. 
19:26 And you* view and hear, that not only from Ephesus, but almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and seduced a considerable crowd, saying that they are not gods, which are born through <i>man’s</i> hands. 
19:27 But not only is there peril <i>in</i> that this career of ours may come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis <i>is</i> to be counted *for nothing and her majesty is also about to be demolished, whom the whole <i>of</i> Asia and the inhabited-earth is worshiping.</p>
<br>
<p>19:28 Now having heard this, they became full of fury and were crying out, saying, Great is Artemis of Ephesus. 
19:29 And the whole city was filled with confusion and they rushed united into the theater, having seized Paul’s fellow traveling-associates, Gaius and Aristarchus, <i>who were</i> Macedonians. 
19:30 Now Paul <i>was</i> planning to enter into the public <i>area</i>, <i>but</i> the disciples were not permitting him. 
19:31 But some also <i>of those</i> from Asia, being his friends, sent for him and were pleading with him not to give himself to the theater <i>crowd</i>. 
19:32 Therefore some were crying one thing and some another; for* the assembly was confused, and most did not know why they had come together. 
19:33 But they pushed Alexander forward out of the crowd <i>with</i> the Jews, casting him forward. Now Alexander, having beckoned <i>with</i> the hand, was wishing to make a defense to the public. 
19:34 But when* they fully knew that he was a Jew, one voice became out of all, for approximately two hours, crying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians. 
19:35 But having the composure of the crowd, the <i>town</i> scribe says, Men of Ephesus, for* what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians <i>is</i> temple-keeper of the great goddess Artemis and of the fallen <i>image</i> from Zeus? 
19:36 Therefore these things being undeniable, it is essential for you* to possess composure and to do nothing rash. 
19:37 For* you* have brought* these men <i>here</i>, <i>who are</i> neither temple looters nor are blaspheming your goddess. 
19:38 Therefore indeed, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are together with him, have an account pertaining to anyone, the lower-courts have been brought* <i>here</i> and there are proconsuls <i>here</i>. Let them accuse one another. 
19:39 But if you* seek anything concerning different <i>things</i>, it will be interpreted in the lawful assembly. 
19:40 For* we also are in peril to be accused concerning today’s riot, no cause exists <i>for it</i> and concerning it, we will not be able to give account of this conspiracy. 
19:41 And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</p>
<h3>Acts 20</h3>
<p>{May 58 to March 59 AD. Games in honor of Diana at Ephesus. 10 months in Europe (Macedonia &amp; Greece). Paul’s Second Letter to the Corinthians is written.}</p>
<p>20:1 Now after the uproar ceased, having called the disciples, Paul hugged <i>them</i>. <i>Then</i> he came out to travel into Macedonia.</p>
<br>
<p>20:2 Now having gone through those parts and having encouraged them with much speech, he came into Greece. 
20:3 Now he made <i>his stay there</i> three months. {AD 58, Paul’s Letter to the Romans is written.}</p>
<p>When* a pact <i>against</i> him by the Jews came* <i>to be</i>, <i>while</i> being about to set-sail *for Syria, it became <i>his</i> intention to return through Macedonia. 
20:4 Now Sopater from Berea, and <i>the</i> Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia, were accompanying him to Asia. 
20:5 But these having gone <i>before</i>, were remaining in Troas for us. 
20:6 Now we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them in Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.</p>
<p>20:7 Now on the first <i>day</i> of the week, the disciples having been gathered together with <i>us</i> to break bread, Paul was reasoning <i>many things</i> with them, being about to go away on the next-day, and he was prolonging his speech {Or: sermon} till midnight. 
20:8 Now a considerable <i>number of</i> lamps were in the upstairs room where we were gathering together with <i>them</i>. 
20:9 But a certain young-man, Eutychus by name, was sitting in the window, being carried away by deep sleep. When* Paul reasoned on <i>even</i> more, having been carried away by his sleep, he fell downward from the third story and was raised <i>up being</i> dead. 
20:10 Now Paul went down and fell upon him, and having embraced him, said, Do not be in an uproar, for* his life is in him.</p>
<p>20:11 Now when* he had gone up, and having broken the bread and having eaten and having conversed on <i>for</i> a considerable <i>time</i>, even till dawn, so he went away. 
20:12 Now they led the living child <i>Eutychus upstairs</i>, and they were immeasurably comforted.</p>
<br>
<p>20:13 But having gone to the ship, we set-sail to Assos, being about to take in Paul from there; for* so he had commanded, he himself being about to go on foot. 
20:14 Now as he encountered* us in Assos, we took him in and came to Mitylene. 
20:15 And sailing from there, we arrived the next <i>day</i> opposite Chios, and <i>then</i> in another <i>day</i>, we put <i>the ship</i> in at Samos, and having remained in Trogyllium, in another <i>day</i> we came to Miletus. 
20:16 For* Paul had decided to sail <i>by</i> Ephesus; for* he was hurrying, *that it might not happen to him to loiter <i>any</i> in Asia; if it was possible for him to come* into Jerusalem <i>on</i> the day of Pentecost.</p>
<br>
<p>{Early 59 AD. Miletus.}</p>
<p>20:17 Now from Miletus, he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the congregation*. 
20:18 Now as they came* to him, he said to them, You* yourselves know, from the first day on which I stepped into Asia, how I was with you* all the time, 
20:19 serving* the Lord with all humility and with many tears, and with tests which befell me in the pacts of the Jews; 
20:20 how I did not retreat back <i>in</i> anything of what is advantageous for you*, proclaiming and teaching you* in public and in every house, 
20:21 thoroughly testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus. 
20:22 And now, behold, I travel to Jerusalem, having been bound in the spirit, not knowing the things that will meet with me <i>there</i>, 
20:23 except* that the Holy Spirit is thoroughly testifying to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions are remaining <i>for</i> me. 
20:24 But I make* account of nothing, nor am I holding my life as precious to myself, as <i>I desire</i> to complete my course with joy, and the service which I received from the Lord Jesus, to thoroughly testify the good-news of the grace of God. 
20:25 And now, behold, I know that you* all, among whom I went preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more, 
20:26 because I testify to you* today, that I am clean from the blood of all men. 
20:27 For* I did not retreat back from proclaiming to you* the whole counsel of God. 
20:28 Therefore, take-heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit placed you* <i>as</i> overseers, to shepherd the congregation* of the Lord and God, which <i>the Lord</i> acquired through his own blood. 
20:29 I know that after my goodbye, cruel wolves will enter into you*, not sparing the flock; 
20:30 and from among yourselves men will stand up, speaking perverse things, to pull away the disciples after themselves. 
20:31 Hence watch, remembering <i>that for</i> three years I ceased not <i>from</i> admonishing each one <i>of you* every</i> day with tears. 
20:32 And hereafter I consign you* brethren to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build <i>you</i>* up and to give you* the inheritance among all those who have been sanctified. 
20:33 I coveted no one’s silver or gold or garment. 
20:34 You* yourselves know that these hands attended to my needs, and to those who were with me. 
20:35 I showed you* <i>an example</i> in all things, that so laboring, you* ought to help the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, <b>It is more fortunate to give than to receive.</b></p>
<br>
<p>20:36 And having said these things, he placed <i>himself on his</i> knees and prayed together with them all. 
20:37 But there became considerable weeping of all, and having fallen upon Paul’s neck, they were kissing him, 
20:38 sorrowing especially upon the word which he had spoken, because they are about to view his face no more. Now they were sending him onward to the ship.</p>
<h3>Acts 21</h3>
<p>{Early 59 AD. Journey to Jerusalem.}</p>
<p>21:1 Now it happened, when* they pulled away to set-sail from them, we made a straight route to Cos, and the next <i>day</i> to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. 
21:2 And having found a ship, ferrying <i>people</i> over into Phoenicia, we stepped on and set-sail. 
21:3 Now when* Cyprus had appeared, leaving it on the left, we were sailing to Syria and brought* <i>the ship</i> into Tyre; for* the ship was to unload her cargo there. 
21:4 And having found disciples, we remained there* seven days, and these <i>disciples</i> were saying to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem. 
21:5 Now when it happened for us to finish the days <i>there</i>, we came out and were traveling <i>onward</i>, and they all, together with <i>their</i> wives and children, sent us onward until we were outside the city, and having placed the knees <i>down</i> upon the beach, we prayed, 
21:6 and having hugged one another, we stepped onto the ship, but those <i>men</i> returned to their own.</p>
<br>
<p>21:7 Now we, having terminated the voyage from Tyre, arrived in Ptolemais, and we greeted the brethren and remained with them <i>for</i> one day. 
21:8 Now on the next-day, Paul and those around him, having went out, came to Caesarea, and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we remained with him. 
21:9 Now there was to this one four prophesying virgin daughters. 
21:10 Now <i>while</i> we are remaining <i>there</i> even more days, a certain prophet from Judea, Agabus by name, came down. 
21:11 And coming to us and taking Paul’s belt, and having bound his own feet and hands, said, The Holy Spirit says these things, <b>The Jews in Jerusalem will bind thus the man whose belt this is, and will give him into the hands of the Gentiles.</b> 
21:12 Now as we heard these things, both we and those locally were pleading with him not to go up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>21:13 But Paul answered, What are you* doing, weeping and crushing my heart? For* I am not only ready to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem on behalf of the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>21:14 But when* he was not persuaded, we were quiet, saying, Let the will of the Lord happen.</p>
<br>
<p>{End of Paul’s Third Missionary Journey.}</p>
<p>21:15 Now after these days, we packed up our baggage and were going up to Jerusalem. 
21:16 But there also went together with us <i>some</i> of the disciples from Caesarea, leading <i>us</i> to someone <i>named</i> Mnason from Cyprus, an old disciple <i>in the faith</i>, with whom <i>they said</i> we should lodge.</p>
<p>21:17 Now when* we came* to Jerusalem, the brethren gladly accepted us.</p>
<br>
<p>{May 23, 59 AD. Jerusalem.}</p>
<p>21:18 Now the next <i>day</i>, Paul was going in together with us to James, and all the elders came. 
21:19 And having greeted them, he was describing one by one the things God had done among the Gentiles through his service. 
21:20 Now when* they heard it, they were glorifying the Lord, saying to him, You are <i>now</i> viewing brother, how many tens of thousands there are of the Jews who have believed, and they are* all zealous <i>ones</i> of the law; 
21:21 and they have been instructed concerning you, that you are teaching all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children nor to walk after the customs. 
21:22 Then* what is it? It is essential for the multitude to certainly come together; for* they will hear that you have come. 
21:23 Therefore you do this <i>thing</i>, what we say to you. We have four men who have a vow upon themselves. 
21:24 <i>Paul</i>, take these and purify yourself together with them, and be spent for them, that* they may shave <i>their</i> heads and all may know that there is no truth in the things of which they have been instructed concerning you, but you yourself also march <i>accordingly</i>, observing the law. 
21:25 But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we <i>have</i> informed <i>them</i> by letter, <i>after</i> having decided, to observe no such thing, except to keep themselves from idol-sacrifices, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication. 
21:26 Then Paul took the men and in the next <i>day</i>, they were going into the temple having been purified together with them, <i>thus</i> thoroughly proclaiming the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered on behalf of each one of them.</p>
<br>
<p>21:27 Now as the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia, when* they saw him in the temple, were inciting all the crowd and put hands upon him, 
21:28 crying out, Men, Israelites, help! This is the man who is teaching against the people, all men everywhere, and <i>against</i> the law and this place, and even more, he brought* Greeks into the temple and has desecrated this holy place. 
21:29 For* they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian together with him before in the city, whom they were supposing that Paul had brought* into the temple. 
21:30 Now the whole city was moved and there happened <i>to be</i> a running of the people together, and they grabbed Paul and were dragging him outside the temple and immediately the doors were locked. 
21:31 But <i>while</i> seeking to kill him, information came up to the commander of the cohort {600 soldiers}, that whole Jerusalem has been incited <i>to riot</i>. 
21:32 Promptly, having taken soldiers and centurions, he ran down upon them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they ceased beating Paul. 
21:33 Now the commander drew near and grabbed him, and commanded <i>him</i> to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he might be, and what he had done. 
21:34 But some in the crowd were crying one thing, some another, and when* he was not able to know the certainty <i>of what happened</i> because of <i>the</i> uproar, he commanded him to be brought* into the encampment. 
21:35 But when he came* upon the steps, it befell <i>him</i> to be bore by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd; 
21:36 for* the multitude of the people was following after, crying out, Take him away.</p>
<br>
<p>21:37 But when* Paul is about to be brought* into the encampment, he says to the commander, Is it legal for me to speak to you?</p>
<p>But he said, Do you know Greek? 
21:38 Are you not then the Egyptian who before these days unsettled <i>the city</i>, and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?</p>
<p>21:39 But Paul said, I am a Jew, indeed a man from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city, and I beseech of you, permit me to speak to the people. 
21:40 Now having permitted him, Paul, standing upon the steps, beckoned with the hand to the people, and when* there became much silence, he was shouting to them in the Hebrew language, saying, <h3>Acts 22</h3> 
22:1 Brethren and fathers! Hear my defense which I now make to you*. 
22:2 But when* they heard that he was shouting to them in the Hebrew language, this provided even more quietness, and he says, 
22:3 Indeed, I am a Jew, having been born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but had been reared in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, having been educated according to the exactness of the Law of our forefathers, being* a zealous one of God, just-as you* all are today; 
22:4 and I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and giving into prisons both men and women. 
22:5 As also the high-priest and all the eldership <i>can</i> testify of me; from whom I also accepted letters to the brethren, and I was traveling to Damascus to lead those who were bound also to Jerusalem, that* they might be punished.</p>
<br>
<p>{Examples of those who were saved in the New Testament: Acts 2:14-42; 8:5-13; 8:30-39; 9:17-18, 22:6-16, 26:12-18; 10:34-48; 16:13-15; 16:25-34; 18:8; 19:1-7.}</p>
<p>22:6 Now it happened to me, <i>while</i> traveling and drawing near to Damascus, around midday, suddenly there flashed around me a considerable light from heaven. 
22:7 And I fell to the solid-ground and heard a voice saying to me, <b>Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?</b></p>
<p>22:8 But I answered, Who are you, Lord?</p>
<p>And he said to me, <b>I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.</b></p>
<p>22:9 But those who were together with me indeed saw the light and became fearful, but they did not hear <i>with understanding</i> the voice of him who spoke to me. 
22:10 But I said, What should I do, Lord?</p>
<p>But the Lord said to me, <b>Stand up and travel into Damascus, and it will be told to you there concerning all things which have been appointed for you to do.</b></p>
<p>22:11 Now as I was not seeing <i>anything apart</i> from the glory of that light, I came into Damascus, being led by the hand by those who were together with me. 
22:12 Now a certain <i>man, named</i> Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well testified of by all the Jews dwelling there, 
22:13 came to me, and standing by me said to me, Brother Saul, recover your sight. And I looked up at him in the same hour. 
22:14 Now he said, The God of our fathers has assigned you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth. 
22:15 Because you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard. 
22:16 And now, why are you hesitating? You yourself, stand up; be immersed* and bathe away your sins, calling upon the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>22:17 Now it happened to me, having returned to Jerusalem, and <i>in</i> my praying in the temple, I came* <i>to be</i> in a trance, 
22:18 and saw him saying to me, <b>Hurry, and go forth quickly out of Jerusalem, because they will not accept for themselves the testimony from you concerning me.</b></p>
<p>22:19 And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I was imprisoning and whipping <i>them</i> in every synagogue, those who believe on you; 
22:20 and when* the blood of Stephen, your witness, was being shed, I was also standing by and <i>was</i> consenting to the assassination of him, guarding the garments of those assassinating him.</p>
<p>22:21 And he said to me, <b>Travel <i>on</i>, because I will send you forth to the Gentiles far from <i>here</i></b>.</p>
<br>
<p>22:22 Now they were hearing him till this speech, and they lifted up their voice and said, Take such a one away from the earth; for* it was not proper <i>for</i> him to live.</p>
<p>22:23 Now when* they were crying out and tossing off their garments and casting dust into the air, 
22:24 the commander commanded him <i>to</i> be brought* into the encampment, saying, <i>He is</i> to be interrogated by scourges, that* he might fully know because of what crime they were shouting out <i>against</i> him so.</p>
<p>22:25 But as they stretched him out with the straps, Paul said to the centurion who is standing <i>there</i>, Is it legal for you* to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?</p>
<p>22:26 But when* the centurion heard it, he went to the commander and reported to him, saying, See what are you about to do? For* this man is a Roman.</p>
<p>22:27 Now the commander came and said to him, Tell me if you are a Roman.</p>
<p>Now he said, Yes.</p>
<p>22:28 And the commander answered, I procured this citizenship of a large sum.</p>
<p>But Paul said, But I have even been <i>Roman</i> born.</p>
<p>22:29 Therefore being about to interrogate him, they immediately withdrew from him. The commander was also afraid, when* he recognized that he was a Roman, and because he was binding <i>him</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>22:30 But on the next-day, planning to know the certainty <i>of</i> why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him from his bonds, and commanded the high-priests and the whole council to come together and brought* Paul down and stood <i>him</i> among them.</p>
<h3>Acts 23</h3>
<p>{May 25, 59 AD. Paul sent to the political capital at Caesarea.}</p>
<p>23:1 Now Paul, staring at the council, said, Brethren, I have behaved-as a <i>Jewish</i> citizen before God in all good conscience till this day.</p>
<p>23:2 But the high-priest Ananias commanded to those who are standing beside him to beat his mouth.</p>
<p>23:3 Then Paul said to him, God is about to beat you, you whitewashed wall. And you sit judging me according to the law, and <i>yet</i> violating the law, you are commanding me to be beaten.</p>
<p>23:4 But those who are standing beside <i>him</i> said, Are you reviling God’s high-priest?</p>
<p>23:5 And Paul said, Brethren, I did not know that he was <i>the</i> high-priest; for* it has been written, ‘You will not speak evilly of a ruler of your people.’ {Ex. 22:28} 
23:6 But when* Paul knew that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of a Pharisee. I am being judged concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead. 
23:7 But when* he said this, there became a dissension from the Pharisees and the multitude was split-apart. 
23:8 (The Sadducees indeed say that there is no resurrection, neither messenger nor spirit, but the Pharisees are confessing both.)</p>
<p>23:9 Now there became a great outcry, and part of the scribes of the Pharisees stood up and were quarreling, saying, We are finding no evil in this man, and what if a spirit has spoken to him, or a messenger? We should not quarrel against God. 
23:10 Now when* much dissension happened, the commander, being scared, lest Paul might be torn to shreds by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and seize him from the midst of them, and bring* him into the encampment.</p>
<br>
<p>23:11 Now when* the Lord stood by him the next night, he said, <b>Paul, have courage; for* as you have thoroughly testified concerning me in Jerusalem, so it is essential <i>for</i> you to also testify in Rome</b>.</p>
<br>
<p>23:12 Now when* it became day, some of the Jews made* a conspiracy and they vowed <i>for</i> themselves, saying, <i>they were</i> neither to eat nor to drink until they should have killed Paul. 
23:13 Now they were more-than forty who had made* this gang; 
23:14 who came to the high-priests and the elders and said, We have vowed, <i>being</i> accursed, to taste nothing until we should have killed Paul. 
23:15 Therefore now, you*, together with the council, disclose <i>it</i> to the commander *that the next-day he should be brought* him down to you*, as <i>if</i> you* are about to investigate more accurately the things concerning him. Now we are ready to kill him before he draws near.</p>
<p>23:16 But Paul’s sister’s son heard of their <i>murderous</i> plot and he came and entered into the encampment and reported to Paul. 
23:17 But Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, Lead this young-man away to the commander; for* he has something to report to him.</p>
<p>23:18 Therefore indeed, he took him and brought* him to the commander and says, Paul the prisoner called me to him, and asked me to bring* this young-man to you, who has something to say to you.</p>
<p>23:19 Now the commander grabbed his hand and departed privately, and inquired, What is it that you have to report to me?</p>
<p>23:20 But he said, The Jews have covenanted <i>together</i> to ask you *that the next-day you should bring* Paul down to the <i>Jewish</i> council, (as <i>if</i> you are about to inquire more accurately something concerning him). 
23:21 Therefore you, do not be persuaded by them; for* more-than forty out of them are plotting against him, who have vowed <i>for</i> themselves neither to eat nor to drink until they should have assassinated him, and they are ready now, waiting for the promise from you.</p>
<p>23:22 Therefore indeed, the commander released the young-man, commanding him, Tell no one that you have disclosed these things to me. 
23:23 And he called to him a certain two of the centurions and said, Prepare <i>for</i> the third hour of the night {i.e. 
9:00 PM} two hundred soldiers and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, *that they should travel to Caesarea, 
23:24 and animals to be present, that* having mounted Paul upon <i>one of them</i>, they might save him for Felix the governor.</p>
<br>
<p>23:25 <i>Now</i> he wrote a letter <i>in</i> this pattern containing:</p>
<br>
<p>23:26 Claudius Lysias to the most-excellent governor Felix. Hail <i>to you</i>. 
23:27 When* this man was taken by the Jews and being about to be assassinated by them, I stood against them, together with the soldiers and liberated him, having learned that he was a Roman. 
23:28 But planning to know the accusation (because of which they were accusing him), I brought* him down to their council; 
23:29 whom I found to be accused concerning debates of their law, but having nothing <i>in way of</i> an accusation worthy of death or of bonds. 
23:30 But when* it was divulged to me that <i>there was</i> a <i>murderous</i> pact about to be <i>carried out</i> by the Jews *for the man, I promptly sent him to you, also commanding his accusers to speak the things to <i>you about</i> him in front of you. Good-bye.</p>
<br>
<p>23:31 Therefore indeed, the soldiers, according to what had been commanded to them, took Paul and brought* him through <i>the</i> night to Antipatris. 
23:32 But on the next-day, they permitted the horsemen to travel together with him and returned to the encampment. 
23:33 <i>Now</i> having entered into Caesarea, and having given over the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him. 
23:34 Now the governor, having read it and having asked what province he was from, and after inquiring, <i>found he was</i> from Cilicia. 
23:35 He said, I will hear you fully whenever your accusers have also come. And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod’s palace.</p>
<h3>Acts 24</h3>
<p>{May 30, 59 AD. Paul before Felix, a prisoner two years at Caesarea. In 59 AD Festus becomes governor of Judea.}</p>
<p>24:1 Now after five days, the high-priest Ananias came down with the elders and an orator, someone <i>named</i> Tertullus, and they disclosed to the governor <i>the charges</i> against Paul. 
24:2 But having been called, Tertullus began to accuse <i>Paul</i>, saying, <i>We are</i> obtaining much peace through you and public-reforms <i>are</i> happening to this nation through your forethought. 
24:3 We accept it both in all things and everywhere, with all thanksgiving, most-excellent Felix. 
24:4 But in order that I may not hinder you more, I plead with you by your gentleness to hear us briefly. 
24:5 For* we have found this man a plague, and <i>he is</i> moving <i>this</i> dissension to all the Jews throughout the inhabited-earth. And <i>he is</i> a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes; 
24:6 who also attempted to profane the temple; whom we also took-hold of. {T} <i>And was willing to be judged according to our law.</i> 
24:7 <i>Now Lysias the commander having come near, with much violence, did take away Paul out of our hands,</i> 
24:8 <i>having commanded his accusers to come to you.</i> From whom you will be able, <i>by</i> examining him yourself, to fully know concerning all these things of which we are accusing him. 
24:9 But the Jews banded together in the attack, claiming these things to be so.</p>
<br>
<p>24:10 Now when* the governor <i>had</i> signaled to him to speak, Paul answered, I know you have been a judge to this nation out of many years <i>experience</i>, I cheerfully am making my defense <i>regarding</i> the things concerning myself. 
24:11 You <i>surely</i> are able to know that it is not more-than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem; 
24:12 and they did not find me reasoning <i>angrily</i> with anyone, or making* of a hostile gathering in the temple, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city, 
24:13 nor are they able to present to you <i>the things</i> concerning <i>me, of</i> which they now are accusing me. 
24:14 But I confess this to you, that after The Way which they call* a sect, so I give-divine service to the God of our forefathers, believing all things which are according to the law and which have been written in the prophets. 
24:15 I have hope toward God, which these themselves also wait for, that there is about to be a resurrection of <i>the</i> dead, both of <i>the</i> righteous and unrighteous. 
24:16 But I apply myself in this, having a guilt-free conscience always toward God and men. 
24:17 Now after many years, I came bringing charity and offerings to my nation; 
24:18 in which they found me, having been purified in the temple, not with a crowd, nor with an uproar. <i>It was with</i> some Jews from Asia, 
24:19 who ought to be here and to accuse <i>me</i> in front of you, if they have anything to <i>accuse</i> me. 
24:20 Or let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found in me when* I stood in front of the council, 
24:21 or concerning this one voice, that I cried out, standing among them. I am being judged by you* today concerning the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<br>
<p>24:22 But Felix, having heard these things and knowing more accurately concerning The Way, postponed <i>judging</i> them, saying, Whenever Lysias the commander comes down, I will investigate the things against you*. 
24:23 And he himself commanded the centurion to guard Paul and to <i>let him</i> have relief <i>from bonds</i>, and to forbid none of his friends to attend or come to him.</p>
<br>
<p>24:24 Now after some days, Felix came together with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. 
24:25 But when* he reasoned concerning righteousness and self-control and the future judgment, Felix becoming fearful, answered, Go-onward now, and when* I take an opportunity, I myself will call you. 
24:26 (He <i>was</i> hoping in the same time <i>that</i> monies will be given to him by Paul, *that he might loose him.) Hence, he sent for him frequently, and was conversing with him. 
24:27 But when* two years were fulfilled, Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus, and wishing to lay up favors for himself with the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.</p>
<h3>Acts 25</h3>
<p>{July, 61 AD. Paul’s appearance before Caesar Nero.}</p>
<p>25:1 Therefore after three days, having stepped into the province, Festus went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. 
25:2 Now the high-priest and the foremost ones of the Jews disclosed to him <i>things</i> against Paul, and they were pleading with him, 
25:3 asking a favor against him, that he might send for him to <i>come to</i> Jerusalem; making* a plot to assassinate him on the road.</p>
<p>25:4 Therefore indeed, Festus answered that Paul was to be kept in Caesarea, and that he himself is about to travel out <i>there</i> shortly. 
25:5 Therefore he says, let those who are of power among you* go down together with <i>me</i>, and if there is anything in this man, let them accuse him.</p>
<p>25:6 Now having stayed among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea. On the next-day he sat upon the judicial-seat and commanded Paul to be brought* <i>before him</i>. 
25:7 Now when* he came, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and cruel accusations against Paul, which they were not strong-enough to show.</p>
<p>25:8 <i>Then Paul,</i> making his defense, <i>said</i>, Neither against the law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar, have I sinned in anything.</p>
<p>25:9 But Festus, wishing to lay up a favor for himself with the Jews, answered and said to Paul, Are you willing to go to Jerusalem and to be judged there concerning these things in front of me?</p>
<p>25:10 But Paul said, I am standing in front of Caesar’s judicial-seat, where I ought to be judged. I did not wrong the Jews, as you also fully well know. 
25:11 For* if I indeed do wrong, and have practiced anything worthy of death, I do not renounce to die, but if none of those things is <i>true</i> of which they are accusing me, no one is able to grant me to them. I myself am appealing to Caesar. 
25:12 Then Festus, having spoken together with the council, answered, You have appealed to Caesar, <i>then</i> you will travel to Caesar.</p>
<br>
<p>25:13 Now when* some days <i>had</i> elapsed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived in Caesarea and greeted Festus. 
25:14 Now as they were staying there many days, Festus submitted to the King, the things according to Paul<i>’s case</i>, saying, There is a certain man, a prisoner, who is left <i>behind</i> by Felix; 
25:15 concerning whom, when* I happened <i>to be</i> in Jerusalem, the high-priests and the elders of the Jews disclosed <i>things to me</i>, asking for a sentence against him. 
25:16 To whom I answered, It is not a custom of the Romans to grant any man to destruction, before he who is accused, might have the accusers face to face, and might receive a chance for defense concerning the accusation.</p>
<br>
<p>25:17 Therefore, when* they came together here, I did not postpone <i>their meeting</i>, but on the next <i>day</i>, sat upon the judicial-seat and commanded the man to be brought. 
25:18 Concerning whom, when* the accusers stood up, they were bringing no accusation of things <i>as</i> I had perceived; 
25:19 but they were having some debates with him concerning their own religion and concerning someone <i>named</i> Jesus, who had died, whom Paul was claiming to be living. 
25:20 But I, being perplexed <i>as</i> to the debate concerning this, was saying <i>to him</i>, if he plans to travel to Jerusalem and to be judged there concerning these things. 
25:21 But when* Paul himself <i>had</i> appealed to be kept *for the decision of the Emperor*, I commanded him to be kept until I should send him to Caesar. 
25:22 But Agrippa said to Festus, I was also planning to hear the man myself.</p>
<p>Now he says, You will hear him on the next-day.</p>
<br>
<p>25:23 Then* on the next-day, Agrippa and Bernice came with much pomp, and entered into the auditorium together with both, the commanders and men according to prominence, who are from the city, and Festus having commanded, Paul was brought* <i>before him</i>. 
25:24 And Festus says, King Agrippa, and all who are here together with us, you* view this man, concerning whom all the multitude of the Jews petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying that it is essential for him to live no longer. 
25:25 But I am comprehending that he has practiced nothing worthy of death, and I decided to send him, <i>since</i> he himself <i>had</i> also appealed to the Emperor*; 
25:26 concerning whom, I do not have any certainty <i>as what</i> to write to my lord. Hence, I led him in front of you* and especially in front of you, King Agrippa, that, after <i>his</i> examination happens, I may have something to write. 
25:27 For* it seems unreasonable to me <i>to be</i> sending a prisoner, and not to signify the accusations against him.</p>
<h3>Acts 26</h3>
<p>{August, AD 61. Paul before Agrippa.}</p>
<p>26:1 Now Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted <i>for</i> you to speak on behalf of yourself. Then Paul stretched out his hand and was making his defense. 
26:2 Concerning all of which I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa, I have deemed myself fortunate today, being about to make my defense in front of you; 
26:3 especially <i>because</i> you are an expert of all things in <i>regard to</i> the Jews, both customs and debates. Hence, I beseech of you to hear me patiently. 
26:4 Then* my lifestyle indeed which happened from my youth up, from the beginning in my own nation and in Jerusalem, all the Jews know <i>this</i>. 
26:5 If they are willing to testify, (knowing me beforehand, from the start), that I lived as a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion. 
26:6 And now I am standing <i>here</i>, being judged against the hope of the promise that came* by God to our fathers; 
26:7 to which our twelve tribes, intensely giving-divine service to <i>God</i> night and day, are hoping to achieve <i>the promise</i>. I am accused by the Jews concerning this hope, <i>O</i> king! 
26:8 Why is it judged <i>as</i> unbelievable with you*, if God is raising the dead? 
26:9 I indeed thought in myself, that I ought to do many things adverse to the name of Jesus the Nazarene. 
26:10 I also did this in Jerusalem, and I locked up many of the holy-ones in prisons, having received authority from the high-priests, and when* they were assassinated, I brought my voting-pebble {i.e. vote} against them. 
26:11 And punishing them often in all the synagogues, I was urging <i>them</i> to blaspheme, and being exceptionally mad with them, I was persecuting <i>them</i>, insofar as <i>possible,</i> even to the cities outside <i>our nation</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>{Examples of those who were saved in the New Testament: Acts 2:14-42; 8:5-13; 8:30-39; 9:17-18, 22:6-16, 26:12-18; 10:34-48; 16:13-15; 16:25-34; 18:8; 19:1-7.}</p>
<p>26:12 In which I also traveled to Damascus with the authority and commission from the high-priests. 
26:13 On the road in <i>the</i> middle of <i>the</i> day, O king, I saw a light from heaven beyond the brilliance of the sun shining around me and those who traveled together with me. 
26:14 Now when* all had fallen down to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language, <b>Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against <i>the</i> cattle-prods.</b></p>
<p>26:15 But I said, Who are you, Lord?</p>
<p>But the Lord said, <b>I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</b> 
26:16 <b>But rise* up and stand upon your feet; for* to this end I have appeared to you, to assign you <i>to be</i> an attendant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of those in which I will appear to you.</b> 
26:17 <b><i>I will be</i> liberating you from the <i>Jewish</i> people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,</b> 
26:18 <b>to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and from the authority of the Adversary to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified in faith, the <i>faith</i> in me.</b></p>
<p>26:19 Hence, O King Agrippa, I did not become disobedient to the heavenly vision. 
26:20 But <i>I was</i> proclaiming first to them in Damascus, and in Jerusalem, and <i>then</i> to all the region of Judea and to the Gentiles, to repent and to turn to God, practicing works worthy of repentance. 
26:21 Because of these things, the Jews took me in the temple and were attempting to slay <i>me</i>. 
26:22 Therefore, having obtained the assistance which <i>is</i> from God, I am standing to this day, testifying both to <i>the</i> little and to <i>the</i> great, saying nothing outside of what the prophets and Moses said was about to happen. 
26:23 If the Christ <i>is</i> to suffer, if <i>he is</i> first from the resurrection of the dead, <i>then</i> he is about to proclaim light to the people and to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>26:24 Now he made his defense <i>with</i> these things.</p>
<p>Festus says with a loud voice, Paul, you are mad; your much scholarship is turning you mad.</p>
<p>26:25 But Paul says, I am not mad, most-excellent Festus, but I speak out <i>the</i> words of truth and self-discipline. 
26:26 For* the king knows concerning these things, to whom I also speak boldly; for* I am persuaded that not any of these things is eluding him; for* this has not been done in a corner. 
26:27 King Agrippa, Do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.</p>
<p>26:28 But Agrippa said to Paul, Are you persuading me to become a Christian in few <i>words</i>?</p>
<p>26:29 But Paul said, I pray to God, that both in a little <i>while</i> or in much <i>time</i>, not only you, but also all who hear me today, <i>are</i> to become such: what sort of <i>person</i>  I am, except-for these bonds.</p>
<p>26:30 And <i>after Paul</i> spoke these things, the king and the governor and Bernice and those who were sitting together with them stood up; 
26:31 and having departed, they were speaking to one another, saying, This man is practicing nothing worthy of death or bonds.</p>
<p>26:32 But Agrippa said to Festus, This man was able to be released, if he had not appealed to Caesar.</p>
<h3>Acts 27</h3>
<p>{Aug. 21 - Nov. 1, 61 AD. Mediterranean Sea. The voyage to Rome.}</p>
<p>27:1 Now as it was decided that we should sail toward Italy, they gave Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion, Julius by name, from <i>the</i> Emperor’s* cohort. 
27:2 Now having stepped <i>on board</i>, in a ship of Adramyttium, which is about to sail to the places throughout <i>the coast of</i> Asia, we set-sail, <i>also</i> being together with us <i>was</i> Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica. 
27:3 And the next-day we brought* <i>the ship</i> into Sidon and Julius treated Paul humanely and permitted <i>him</i> to travel to <i>his</i> friends and be cared for. 
27:4 And setting-sail to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were adverse. 
27:5 And having sailed through the sea against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, <i>a city</i> of Lycia. 
27:6 And the centurion found a ship from Alexandria there sailing to Italy, and he has us step onto it. 
27:7 Now at a considerable number of days, <i>we were</i> voyaging slowly and happened <i>to be</i> against Cnidus with difficulty; the wind <i>was</i> not permitting us <i>to land</i>. We sailed under the lee of Crete, over against Salmone; 
27:8 and coasting-along it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called Good Harbors; which was near the city of Lasea.</p>
<br>
<p>27:9 Now when* a considerable <i>amount</i> of time had elapsed and the voyage was already dangerous, because the Fast had already passed, Paul was advising them, 
27:10 and said to them, Men, I view that the voyage is about to be with disaster and much damage, not only of the load and the ship, but also of our lives. 
27:11 But the centurion was being persuaded by the helmsman and by the ship-owner, rather than by the things spoken by Paul. 
27:12 But the harbor being* unfit for a wintering, most purposed to set-sail to sea from there, if somehow they might arrive and winter near Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, looking down northwest and down southwest. 
27:13 Now when* the south <i>wind</i> blew softly, thinking to have taken-hold of their purpose, they lifted <i>the anchor</i> up and were coasting-along, closer to Crete. 
27:14 But not long after, a typhoon wind, called Euroclydon, was cast against it; 
27:15 and when* the ship was seized and it was not able to face the wind, we gave way <i>to it,</i> and were being carried along <i>by the wind</i>. 
27:16 Now having ran under the lee of a certain isle called Clauda, we were strong-enough to become skippers of the boat with difficulty; 
27:17 and they, having lifted it up, were using cables, undergirding the ship, and fearing lest they might fall <i>upon</i> the <i>sandbars of</i> Syrtis, they lowered the tackling and so we were being carried along. 
27:18 But being extremely storm-tossed, the next <i>day</i> they were making* a jettison <i>of the cargo</i>; 
27:19 and the third day they tossed out the tackling of the ship with their own hands. 
27:20 But when* neither sun nor stars appeared upon <i>us for</i> many days and not <i>just</i> a small storm <i>was</i> laying upon <i>us,</i> all our hope to be saved was furthermore taken away.</p>
<p>27:21 Now they are without much food {i.e. almost starving}, then Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said, O men, it was essential for you* to have been obedient to me <i>and</i> to have not set-sail from Crete and <i>then</i> to have gained this disaster and damage. 
27:22 And hereafter, I am advising you* to be cheerful; for* <i>there will be</i> no termination of life from <i>among</i> you*, however of the ship, <i>yes</i>. 
27:23 For* there stood beside me this night a messenger of the God, whose I am, whom I also am giving-divine service to, 
27:24 saying, Do not fear, Paul; it is essential <i>for</i> you to stand-before Caesar and behold, God has granted to you all those who are sailing with you. 
27:25 Hence, lords, be cheerful; for* I believe God, that it will be so according to the manner it has been spoken to me. 
27:26 But it is essential for us to fall onto a certain island.</p>
<br>
<p>27:27 Now as it became the fourteenth night, being carried <i>to and fro</i> in the Adriatic <i>Sea</i>, in the middle of the night, the sailors were perceiving some region to be coming <i>up</i> before them. 
27:28 And having sounded, they found twenty fathoms, and <i>after</i> a little bit <i>of</i> an interval <i>of time</i>, having sounded again, they found fifteen fathoms. 
27:29 And fearing lest we might fall into rough places, they tossed <i>the</i> four anchors from the stern and was praying <i>for</i> it to become day. 
27:30 But the sailors <i>were</i> seeking to flee out of the ship and having lowered the boat into the sea in pretext, as <i>though</i> they are about to heave out anchors from the prow, 
27:31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, If these <i>sailors</i> do not remain in the ship, you* are not able to be saved. 
27:32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off. 
27:33 Now till it was about to become day, Paul was encouraging them all to take some nourishment, saying, Today is the fourteenth day that you* were expecting <i>to arrive</i> and <i>that</i> you* are continuing without food, having taken nothing <i>to eat</i> for yourselves. 
27:34 Hence I am encouraging you* to take some nourishment; for* this is* for your* salvation; for* not a hair will fall from head of one of you. 
27:35 Now having said these things and had taken bread, he gave-thanks to God in the sight of all, and he broke it and began to eat. 
27:36 When* all became cheerful, they themselves also took nourishment. 
27:37 Now we were in the ship, all two hundred and seventy six souls. 
27:38 Now being satisfied from <i>the</i> nourishment, they lightened the ship, casting the grain out into the sea.</p>
<br>
<p>{Nov. 1, 61 AD. Shipwreck on Malta.}</p>
<p>27:39 Now when it became day, they were not recognizing the land, but were considering a certain bay, having a beach and they counseled if <i>it was</i> possible to drive the ship upon it. 
27:40 And having taken off the <i>couplings to the</i> anchors, they were permitting them <i>to fall</i> in the sea, at the same time laxing the rudders’ couplings, and lifting up the foresail to the blowing <i>wind</i>, they were heading toward the beach. 
27:41 But having fallen into a place at the intersection of two seas, they beached the cargo-ship, and indeed the prow stuck and remained unshakable, but the stern was being dissolved by the violence of the waves.</p>
<p>27:42 Now the soldiers’ counsel happened <i>to be</i> that* they should kill the prisoners, lest they should swim out <i>and</i> flee). 
27:43 But the centurion, planning to save Paul, did forbid them from <i>their</i> will, and commanded those who were able to swim to toss themselves over first and go out to land; 
27:44 and the rest, some upon planks and some upon <i>other</i> things from the ship. And so it happened, all <i>were</i> to be saved upon the land.</p>
<h3>Acts 28</h3>
<p>{Nov. - Feb. 62 AD. Malta.}</p>
<br>
<p>28:1 And having been saved, then we recognized that the island was called Malta. 
28:2 Now the barbarians were providing us exceptional kindliness; for* they lit a fire and received us all, because of the standing rainfall and because of the cold. 
28:3 But when* Paul twisted together a bunch of brush and having laid <i>it</i> upon the fire, a viper attached to his hand, having come out through the brush from the warmth. 
28:4 Now as the barbarians saw the snake hanging from his hand, they were saying to one another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom, having been saved out of the sea, justice did not permit <i>him</i> to live. 
28:5 Therefore indeed, he shook-off the snake into the fire <i>and</i> suffered no evil. 
28:6 But they were expecting that he was about to swell up or to suddenly fall down dead. But expecting <i>it</i> for a long time and viewing nothing improper happening to him, having a turnabout, they were saying that he was a god.</p>
<br>
<p>28:7 Now in the <i>regions</i> around that place, were* farms possessed by the foremost one of the island, Publius by name, who accepted us and lodged us courteously three days. 
28:8 Now it happened, that the father of Publius lay <i>sick</i>, troubled with fevers and dysentery; to whom Paul having entered and prayed <i>and</i> laid his hands on him, healed him. 
28:9 Therefore, when* this happened, the rest who had sicknesses in the island also were coming and were being healed, 
28:10 who also honored us with many honors, and when* we sailed, they placed on <i>the ship</i> the things *for <i>our</i> need.</p>
<p>28:11 Now after three months, we were led to a ship from Alexandria with an insignia of The Twin Brothers which had wintered in the island.</p>
<br>
<p>{March, 62 - March 64. Rome.}</p>
<p>28:12 And bringing* <i>the ship</i> into Syracuse, we remained there three days. 
28:13 From where we went around and arrived at Rhegium and after one day a south <i>wind</i> came upon <i>us</i> and on the second <i>day</i> we came to Puteoli; 
28:14 where we found brethren and were encouraged to remain on <i>with</i> them seven days and so we came to Rome. 
28:15 And the brethren from there, when* they heard concerning us, came to <i>the</i> encounter with us out to the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns; whom when* Paul saw, he thanked God and took courage.</p>
<br>
<p>28:16 Now when we came to Rome, the centurion gave the prisoners to the camp-commander, but Paul was permitted to abide by himself together with the soldier guarding him.</p>
<br>
<p>28:17 Now it happened, that after three days Paul called together those who were the foremost of the Jews and when* they came together, he said to them, Brethren, I have done nothing adverse to the people or the customs of our forefathers. I, a prisoner from Jerusalem, was given up into the hands of the Romans. 
28:18 The Romans, who having examined <i>me</i>, were planning to release me, because no crime exists <i>worthy</i> of death in me. 
28:19 But the Jews <i>were</i> speaking against <i>it</i>, <i>then</i> I was urged to appeal to Caesar; not that I had anything of which to accuse my nation. 
28:20 Then*, because of this cause, I pleaded with you* to see and to speak to <i>you*</i>; for* I am encompassed <i>with</i> this chain because of the hope of Israel<i>.</i></p>
<p>28:21 But they said to him, We neither accepted writings from Judea concerning you, nor did anyone of the brethren come here and report or speak anything evil concerning you. 
28:22 But we deem <i>it</i> worthy to hear from you what things you are mindful of; for* indeed, concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.</p>
<br>
<p>28:23 Now having appointed him a day, they were coming to him, into his lodging in great number; to whom he was expounding <i>the matter,</i> thoroughly testifying the kingdom of God and persuading them the things concerning Jesus, both from the Law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until dusk. 
28:24 And some were believing and some were disbelieving the things which were spoken. 
28:25 But when* they disagreed among themselves, they were dismissing <i>themselves</i> after Paul had spoken <i>just</i> one declaration, The Holy Spirit spoke well through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers, 
28:26 saying, ‘You travel to this people and say, In hearing you* will hear and <i>yet</i> may never* understand, and seeing you* will see and <i>yet</i> may never* see; 
28:27 for* this people’s heart has become-callous and they have selectively heard with their ears and they have closed their eyes. Lest, they should see with their eyes and should hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should return and I will heal them.’ {Isa 6:9-10}</p>
<p>28:28 Therefore let it be known to you*, that this salvation from God is sent to the Gentiles and they will hear. 
28:29 And having said these words, the Jews went away, having much debate among themselves.</p>
<p>28:30 Now Paul remained two whole years in his own rented-house and was accepting all who traveled to him, 
28:31 preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, unforbidden <i>by any</i>.</p>

<h3>Romans 1</h3>
<p>{If you are reading the Letters written to Christians first, this is a better and more chronological order: James, 1&amp;2 Thessalonians, Galatians, 1&amp;2 Corinthians, Romans, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1&amp;2 Peter, Jude, Philemon, 1 Timothy, Titus, Hebrews, 2 Timothy, 1-3 John, Revelation.}</p>
<br>
<p>1:1 Paul, bondservant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, having been separated* to the good-news of God, 
1:2 which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, 
1:3 concerning his Son, (who was born from <i>the</i> seed of David according to the flesh, 
1:4 who has been determined <i>as being</i> the Son of God in power, according to the spirit of holiness, out of the resurrection of the dead), Jesus Christ our Lord. 
1:5 Through whom, we received grace and apostleship, into <i>the</i> obedience of <i>the</i> faith in all the nations, on behalf of his name; 
1:6 among whom you* are also called of Jesus Christ. 
1:7 To all those who are in Rome, beloved of God, called holy-ones: grace to you* and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>1:8 First indeed, I am giving-thanks to my God through Jesus Christ on behalf of you* all, that your* faith is proclaimed in the whole world. 
1:9 For* God is my witness, whom I am giving-divine service in my spirit in the good-news of his Son, how constantly I make* a remembrance of you*. 
1:10 I beseech <i>God</i>, if somehow now, I will be prospered by the will of God to come to you* someday, 
1:11 for* I am longing to see you*, that* I may give to you* some spiritual gift*, *that* you* may be established; 
1:12 and that is <i>also that*</i> I might be comforted together among you*, through the faith, <i>of</i> both yours* and mine, <i>which is</i> in one another. 
1:13 Now brethren, I do not wish you* to be ignorant that I often purposed to come to you* (and was prevented till presently), that* I might also have some fruit among you*, just-as among the rest of the Gentiles. 
1:14 I am a debtor both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. 
1:15 So, <i>as</i> in me, <i>I am</i> eager to proclaim the good-news to you* also who are in Rome.</p>
<br>
<p>1:16 For* I am not ashamed of the good-news of Christ; for* it is the power of God *for salvation to everyone who believes; both to the Jew first and to the Greek. 
1:17 For* in it <i>the</i> righteousness of God is revealed from faith to {Or: into} faith; just-as it has been written, ‘But the righteous will live from faith.’ {Hab. 2:4}</p>
<br>
<p>1:18 For* the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who are holding back the truth in unrighteousness; 
1:19 because what is known of God is apparent in them; for* God manifested it to them. 
1:20 For* the invisible things of him are clearly seen from the creation of the world, being perceived by the produced things, <i>both</i> his eternal power and divinity; *that* they may be without defense; 
1:21 because having known God, they did not glorify him as God, nor gave-thanks, but became-futile in their reasonings and their heart, which has no understanding, was darkened. 
1:22 They were foolish, claiming to be wise, 
1:23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man, of birds, of four footed mammals and reptiles.</p>
<br>
<p>1:24 Hence also, God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, *that* their bodies should be dishonored among themselves. 
1:25 They exchanged the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and gave-divine service to the created thing against {Or: contrary to} him who created <i>it</i>, who is gracious* forever. Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>1:26 Because of this, God gave them up to passions of dishonor; for* their females exchanged the natural use into what is beyond <i>anything</i> natural; 
1:27 and the males also likewise, leaving the natural use of the female, burned in their lust toward one another, males with* males working indecent deeds and receiving in themselves the recompense which was essential from their error.</p>
<p>1:28 And just-as they did not approve to have God in <i>their</i> full knowledge, God gave them up to an unapproved mind, to do those things which are not proper. 
1:29 They have been filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, greed, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, treachery, maliciousness. <i>They are</i> malicious whisperers, 
1:30 slandering, spiteful to God, insolent, haughty, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 
1:31 without understanding, covenant-breakers, cold-hearted, implacable <i>and</i> unmerciful. 
1:32 Who, having fully known the ordinance of God, (<i>that</i> those who practice such things are worthy of death), are not only doing the same things, but also are consenting with those who practice them.</p>
<h3>Romans 2</h3>
<p>2:1 Hence you are without defense, O man, who judges; for* in what you are judging the other, you are condemning yourself; for* you who judge are practicing the same things. 
2:2 Now we have known that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who practice such things. 
2:3 Now O man, who is judging those who practice such things and you are practicing the same <i>yourself.</i> Are you reasoning that you will flee away from the judgment of God? 
2:4 Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, being ignorant that the kindness of God leads you to repentance? 
2:5 But you store up wrath for yourself according to your hardness and unrepentant heart in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; 
2:6 who will ‘repay to each according to his works.’ {Ps 62:12} 
2:7 Indeed eternal life to those who are seeking, according to endurance, in doing good for glory and honor and incorruption. 
2:8 But to those <i>who act</i> out of selfish ambition and who are indeed disobedient to the truth, but obey unrighteousness, <i>he will repay with</i> fury and wrath, 
2:9 affliction and distress, upon every soul of man who is working evil, both of the Jew first and of the Greek. 
2:10 But glory and honor and peace to every man who is working good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek; 
2:11 for* there is no partiality with God.</p>
<p>2:12 For* as many as have sinned without <i>the</i> law will also perish without <i>the</i> law. And as many as have sinned under the law will be judged through the law. 
2:13 For* the hearers of the law are not righteous with God, but the doers of the law will be justified. 
2:14 For* whenever <i>the</i> Gentiles, not having the law, practice the things of the law by nature, these, not having the law, are the law to themselves; 
2:15 in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying together with <i>their hearts,</i> and between one another, their reasonings <i>are</i> accusing or either defending <i>them</i>; 
2:16 in <i>the</i> day when God will judge the secrets of men through Jesus Christ, according to my good-news.</p>
<br>
<p>2:17 Behold, you who is named a Jew and rest upon the law and boast in God, 
2:18 and know his will and approve the things that carry more-value, being instructed out of the law, 
2:19 and have confidence that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of those <i>who are</i> in darkness, 
2:20 a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth. 
2:21 Therefore you who are teaching a different <i>one</i>, are you not teaching yourself? You who are preaching a man should not steal, are you stealing? 
2:22 You who say a man should not commit adultery, are you committing adultery? You who detest idols, are you a temple looter? 
2:23 You who are boasting in the law, through your transgression of the law, are you dishonoring God? 
2:24 ‘For* the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you*,’ just-as it has been written. {Isa 52:5} 
2:25 For* circumcision indeed profits, if you practice <i>the</i> law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. 
2:26 Therefore, if the uncircumcision are observing the ordinances of the law, will his uncircumcision not be counted toward circumcision? 
2:27 And the uncircumcision <i>who is</i> completing the law by nature, will judge you, who are a transgressor of the law through the writing and circumcision. 
2:28 For* he is not a Jew who <i>appears as one</i> openly; neither is circumcision what is openly in <i>the</i> flesh, 
2:29 but a Jew is he who <i>is so</i> hidden, and <i>the</i> circumcision <i>is</i> that of the heart, in spirit, not in a writing; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</p>
<h3>Romans 3</h3>
<p>3:1 Therefore what is the supremacy of the Jew? Or what is the profit of circumcision? 
3:2 Much, according to every manner! For* indeed, first, that they were entrusted <i>with</i> the oracles of God. 
3:3 For* what if some disbelieved? Their unbelief will not do-away-with the faith<i>fulness</i> of God, will it? 
3:4 Let it not happen! Now, let God become true, but every man a liar; as it has been written, ‘*That you should be justified in your words and may overcome <i>when</i> being judged.’ {Psa 51:4} 
3:5 For* if our unrighteousness is establishing the righteousness of God, what will we say? The God who brings upon <i>us</i> wrath is not unrighteous, is he? (I speak according to <i>the manner of</i> man.) 
3:6 Let it not happen! Otherwise how will God judge the world? 
3:7 But if the truth of God in my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still being judged like a sinner? 
3:8 And why should we not do evil, in order that good things should come (just-as we are blasphemed and just-as some say we speak <i>likewise</i>)? Whose condemnation is just!</p>
<br>
<p>3:9 Then* what? Are we special? Certainly not; for* we accused beforehand, both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin; 
3:10 as it has been written, ‘There is none righteous, not even one. 
3:11 There are none who are understanding. There are none who are seeking out God. 
3:12 They shunned <i>God</i>. They became-useless at the same time. There is no <i>one</i> practicing kindness; there is not insofar as <i>even</i> one.’ {Psa 14:1-3 &amp; 53:1-3} 
3:13 ‘Their throat has been an open burial chamber; they were treacherous with their tongues.’ {Psa 5:9} ‘The poison of asps <i>is</i> under their lips.’ {Psa 140:3} 
3:14 ‘Whose mouth is full of evil-cursing and bitterness.’ {Psa 10:7?} 
3:15 ‘Their feet <i>are</i> swift to shed blood; 
3:16 downfall and miseries <i>are</i> in their ways; 
3:17 and they did not know <i>the</i> way of peace.’ {Isa 59:7,8} 
3:18 ‘There is no fear of God in front of their eyes.’ {Psa 36:1}</p>
<br>
<p>3:19 Now we know that inasmuch as the law says, it is speaking to those in the law; that* every mouth may be sealed and all the world may become under the sentence of God; 
3:20 because no flesh will be justified in his sight from the works of the law; for* through the law <i>comes</i> the full knowledge of sin.</p>
<br>
<p>3:21 But now <i>the</i> righteousness of God has been manifested separate from the law, being testified by the law and the prophets; 
3:22 even <i>the</i> righteousness of God through faith of Jesus Christ toward all and upon all those who believe; for* there is no distinction; 
3:23 for* all have sinned and come-short of the glory of God. 
3:24 <i>All those who believe,</i> being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption which <i>is</i> in Christ Jesus, 
3:25 whom God purposed <i>to be</i> an atonement in his blood, through the faith, *for an example of his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins having been done beforehand, in the forbearance of God, 
3:26 to <i>be</i> the example of his righteousness in this current time, *that* he may himself be righteous and justifying him who <i>is</i> from <i>the</i> faith of Jesus.</p>
<p>3:27 Therefore where is the boasting? It was locked out. Through what law? Of works? No, but through a law through faith. 
3:28 Therefore, we reason that a man is justified in faith separate from the works of the law. 
3:29 Or is God <i>the God</i> of Jews only? Is he not <i>the God</i> of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also. 
3:30 Since God is one, <i>it is he</i> who will justify the circumcision out of faith and the uncircumcision through the faith. 
3:31 Therefore, do we do-away-with the law through the faith? Let it not happen! But <i>through the faith,</i> we are establishing <i>the</i> law.</p>
<h3>Romans 4</h3>
<p>4:1 Then* what will we say, that Abraham, our father, has found according to the flesh? 
4:2 For* if Abraham was justified out of works, he has <i>grounds for</i> boasting, but not toward God. 
4:3 For* what does the Scripture say? ‘And Abraham believed God and it was counted to him *for righteousness.’ {Gen 15:6} 
4:4 Now to him who is working, the reward is not counted according to grace, but according to debt. 
4:5 But to him who is not working, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted *for righteousness. 
4:6 Just-as David also says <i>concerning</i> the good-fortune upon the man to whom God counts righteousness separate from works, 
4:7 <i>saying</i>, ‘Fortunate are those whose lawlessnesses are forgiven and whose sins are covered. 
4:8 The man to whom the Lord may never* count sin, is fortunate.’ {Psa 32:1,2} 
4:9 Then* <i>is</i> this good-fortune <i>placed</i> upon the circumcision or also upon the uncircumcision? For* we say that his faith was counted to Abraham *for righteousness. 
4:10 Then* how was it counted? When* he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 
4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which <i>he had</i> in the uncircumcision, *that* he might be the father of all those who believe, <i>even while</i> in uncircumcision, *that* righteousness might also be counted to them; 
4:12 and the father of circumcision, to those who are not only from the circumcision, but who also are marching in the footprints of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision.</p>
<p>4:13 For* the promise <i>was</i> to Abraham, or to his seed, for him to be heir of the world, but not through the law, <i>but</i> through the righteousness of faith. 
4:14 For* if those who are from the law are heirs, the faith has been made void and the promise has been done-away-with. 
4:15 For* the law is working wrath; for* where there is no law, neither is there transgression. 
4:16 Because of this, <i>it is</i> out of faith, that* <i>it may be</i> according to grace; *that* the promise may be steadfast to all the seed; not to what <i>is</i> only from the law, but also to what <i>is</i> out of <i>the</i> faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, 
4:17 (as it has been written, ‘I have placed you <i>as</i> a father of many nations’ {Gen. 17:5}), in front of him whom he believed– God, who is giving-life to the dead and is calling the things that are not, as <i>though</i> they were. 
4:18 <i>Abraham</i> who contrary to hope believed upon hope, *that* he might become a father of many nations, according to what had been spoken, So your seed will be. {Gen. 15:5}</p>
<p>4:19 And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already sterile, (being* nearly a hundred years), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb. 
4:20 Yet, <i>looking</i> toward the promise of God, he did not doubt through unbelief, but became empowered through faith, having given glory to God, 
4:21 and being fully assured that what he has promised; he is able also to perform. 
4:22 Hence it was also counted to him *for righteousness. 
4:23 Now it was not written, ‘It was counted to him,’ because of him only; 
4:24 but also, because of us to whom it is about to be counted, who believe on him who raised <i>up</i> Jesus our Lord from the dead, 
4:25 who was given up because of our trespasses and was raised <i>up</i> because of our justification.</p>
<h3>Romans 5</h3>
<p>5:1 Therefore having been justified out of faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ; 
5:2 through whom we also have had our access in the faith into this grace in which we are standing, and we are boasting in hope of the glory of God. 
5:3 But not only <i>in this</i>, but we are also boasting in our afflictions, knowing that affliction is working endurance; 
5:4 and endurance, approved character, and an approved character, hope; 
5:5 and hope does not shame <i>one</i>, because the love* of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us. 
5:6 For* when* we were still weak, according to <i>the proper</i> time, Christ died on behalf of the ungodly. 
5:7 For* scarcely will one die on behalf of a righteous man; for* perhaps someone might even dare to die on behalf of the good man. 
5:8 But God is establishing his own love* toward us, <i>in</i> that when* we were still sinners, Christ died on our behalf. 
5:9 Then* much more, having been now justified in his blood, we will be saved from the wrath <i>of God</i> through him. 
5:10 For* if, when* we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, we will be saved by his life; 
5:11 and not only <i>so</i>, but <i>we are</i> also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.</p>
<br>
<p>5:12 Because of this, just-as sin entered into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death has gone forth to all men, in which all have sinned. 
5:13 For* till the law sin was in the world, but sin is not charged to one’s account when* there is no law. 
5:14 But death reigned from Adam till Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a pattern of the future <i>one.</i> 
5:15 But not like the trespass, so also <i>is</i> the gift*. For* if the many died by the trespass of the one, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, has abound to the many. 
5:16 Now the gift is not through one who sinned; for* indeed the judgment <i>came</i> from one to condemnation, but the gift* <i>came</i> from many trespasses to an <i>act of</i> righteousness. 
5:17 For* if, by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; much more they, who are receiving the abundance of the grace and of the gift of righteousness, will reign in life through the one, <i>who is</i> Jesus Christ. 
5:18 Then* consequently*, as through one trespass <i>the judgment came</i> to all men to condemnation; so through one <i>act of</i> righteousness <i>the gift</i> also <i>came</i> to all men to justification of life. 
5:19 For* as through the one man’s disobedience* the many were designated <i>as</i> sinners, so also through the obedience of the one the many will be designated <i>as</i> righteous. 
5:20 But the law entered in besides, that* the trespass might increase, but where sin increased, grace over-abounded; 
5:21 that*, just-as sin reigned in death, so grace might also reign through righteousness to everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<h3>Romans 6</h3>
<p>6:1 Then* what will we say? Are we remaining in sin, in order that grace may increase? 
6:2 Let it not happen! We who died to sin, how will we live in it any longer? 
6:3 Or are you* ignorant that as many as were immersed* into Christ Jesus were immersed* into his death? 
6:4 Therefore we were buried together with him through the immersion* into death; that* just-like Christ was raised <i>up</i> from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we might also walk in newness of life. 
6:5 For* if we have become unified together with <i>him</i> in the likeness of his death, we will also be <i>unified with him in the likeness</i> of his resurrection. 
6:6 Knowing this, that our old man was crucified together with <i>him</i>, in order that the body of sin might be done-away, that <i>we are</i> to no longer be enslaved to sin; 
6:7 for* he who has died has been justified away from sin. 
6:8 But if we died together with Christ, we believe that we will also live together with him; 
6:9 knowing that Christ having been raised <i>up</i> from the dead dies no more; death has no more lordship over him. 
6:10 For* the death that he died, he died to sin once for all, but the life that he is living, he is living to God. 
6:11 So you* also, count yourselves to be indeed dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>6:12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your* mortal body, *that* you* might obey* it in its lusts; 
6:13 nor present your* members to sin <i>as</i> weapons of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God, as living from the dead and your* members <i>as</i> weapons of righteousness to God. 
6:14 For* sin will not have lordship over you*; for* you* are not under law, but under grace. 
6:15 Then* what? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? Let it not happen! 
6:16 Do you* not know, that to whom you* present yourselves <i>as</i> bondservants to obedience, you* are <i>the</i> bondservants to whom you* obey*; either of sin to death or of obedience to righteousness? 
6:17 But gratitude to God, that, <i>though</i> you* were bondservants of sin, you* obeyed* from the heart to that pattern of teaching to which you* were given; 
6:18 and having been made free from sin, you* were enslaved to righteousness.</p>
<p>6:19 I speak <i>in</i> human <i>terms</i> because of the weakness of your* flesh; for* just-as you* presented your* members <i>as</i> bondservants to uncleanness and to lawlessness <i>leading</i> to <i>more</i> lawlessness, so now present your* members <i>as</i> bondservants to righteousness <i>leading</i> to sanctification. 
6:20 For* when you* were bondservants of sin, you* were free <i>in regard</i> to the righteousness. 
6:21 Therefore, what fruit were you* having then in the things of which you* are now ashamed? For* the end of those things is death. 
6:22 But now, having been made free from sin and having been enslaved to God, you* have your* fruit <i>leading</i> to sanctification and the end everlasting life. 
6:23 For* the compensation of sin is death, but the gift* of God is everlasting life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<h3>Romans 7</h3>
<p>7:1 Or are you* ignorant, brethren (for* I am speaking to men who know the law), that the law has lordship over a man inasmuch time as he is living? 
7:2 For* the woman in wedlock has been bound by law to the living husband, but if the husband dies, she has been discharged {Greek: done-away} from the law of the husband. 
7:3 Then* consequently*, if while the husband is living, she becomes <i>joined</i> to a different man, she will be divinely-called, an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, she is not an adulteress, <i>even</i> if she had become <i>joined</i> to a different man. 
7:4 So-then my brethren, you* were also slain to the law through the body of Christ; *that* you* should become <i>joined</i> to a different <i>one</i>, <i>that is</i> to him who was raised <i>up</i> from the dead, that* we might bear-fruit to God. 
7:5 For* when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law, was working in our members, *that* they might bear-fruit to death. 
7:6 But now we have been discharged {Greek: done-away} from the law, having died <i>in that</i> in which we were being held; so-that we serve* in newness of the spirit and not in oldness of the writing.</p>
<br>
<p>7:7 Then* what shall we say? <i>Is</i> the law sin? Let it not happen! But, I had not known sin, except through the law; for* I had not known coveting {Greek: lust}, except <i>that</i> the law was saying, Do not covet {Greek: lust}. 
7:8 But sin, having taken a starting-point, worked in me through the commandment all <i>manner of</i> coveting {Greek: lust}; for* separate from the law sin <i>is</i> dead. 
7:9 But I was previously living separate from the law, but when* the commandment came, sin lived again <i>through me</i> and I died; 
7:10 and the commandment, which <i>was</i> to life, I found this <i>to be</i> to death; 
7:11 for* sin, having taken a starting-point through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. 
7:12 So-that the law indeed is holy and the commandment holy and righteous and good. 
7:13 Then* what is good to me, has it become death? Let it not happen! But sin, in order that it might appear <i>as</i> sin, through what is good to me, was working death; in order that sin might become a surpassingly-better sinner through the commandment. 
7:14 For* we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, having been sold* under sin.</p>
<p>7:15 For* I do not know what I am working; for* not what I will– I am doing this, but what I hate– I am practicing this. 
7:16 But if what I do not will, this I am practicing, I assent together with the law; that <i>it is</i> good. 
7:17 So now no longer am I working it, but <i>the</i> sin which is dwelling in me. 
7:18 For* I know nothing good is dwelling in me, (that is, in my flesh); for* it is laying beside me to will <i>it</i>, but to work what is good, I am not finding <i>it</i>. 
7:19 For* the good which I will, I am not practicing, but the evil which I do not will– I am doing this. 
7:20 But if what I do not will, this I am practicing, no longer am I working it, but <i>the</i> sin which is dwelling in me. 
7:21 Consequently*, I find the law to me, who is willing to practice the good things– evil is laying beside <i>me</i>.</p>
<p>7:22 For* I delight-inwardly in the law of God according to the inward man. 
7:23 But I am seeing a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and capturing me in the law of sin which is in my members. 
7:24 <i>O</i> I <i>am</i> a miserable man! Who will rescue me out of the body of this death? 
7:25 I am giving-thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Then* consequently*, I myself, indeed, serve* the law of God with the mind, but with the flesh <i>I serve</i>* the law of sin.</p>
<h3>Romans 8</h3>
<br>
<p>8:1 Consequently* now <i>there is</i> no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who are not walking according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. 
8:2 For* the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death. 
8:3 For* the law <i>being</i> powerless, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh; 
8:4 in order that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who are not walking according to the flesh, but <i>walking</i> according to the Spirit. 
8:5 For* those who are according to the flesh are mindful of the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit <i>are mindful</i> of the things of the Spirit. 
8:6 For* the mindset of the flesh is death, but the mindset of the Spirit is life and peace; 
8:7 because the mindset of the flesh is enmity at God; for* it is not subject to the law of God, for* neither is it able <i>to be</i>; 
8:8 and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God. 
8:9 But you* are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed* the Spirit of God is dwelling in you*. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not his. 
8:10 But if Christ is in you*, the body is indeed dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. 
8:11 But if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus <i>up</i> from the dead is dwelling in you*, he who raised the Christ <i>up</i> from the dead will also give-life to your* mortal bodies through his Spirit who is dwelling in you*.</p>
<br>
<p>8:12 Then* consequently*, brethren, we are debtors <i>but</i> not to the flesh, <i>not</i> to live according to the flesh; 
8:13 for* if you* live according to the flesh, you* are about to die, but if you* slay the practices of the body in spirit, you* will live. 
8:14 For* as many as are led by <i>the</i> Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 
8:15 For* you* did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you* received the spirit of sonship, in which we cry, Abba, Father. 
8:16 The Spirit himself is testifying together with our spirit, that we are children of God; 
8:17 and if children, then heirs; indeed, heirs of God and joint heirs of Christ; if indeed* we are suffering together with <i>him</i>, that* we might also be glorified together with <i>him</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>8:18 For* I reason that the sufferings of this current time are not worthy <i>in comparison</i> to the glory which is about to be revealed to us. 
8:19 For* the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for the revealing of the sons of God. 
8:20 For* the creation was subjected to futility, not voluntarily, but because of him who subjected it, in hope 
8:21 that even the creation itself will be made free from the bondage of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. 
8:22 For* we know that the whole creation groans and travails together <i>in pain</i> till now. 
8:23 But not only <i>they</i>, but we ourselves also who have the first-fruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves are groaning in ourselves, waiting for <i>our</i> sonship, <i>that is</i>, the redemption of our body. 
8:24 For* we were saved in hope; but hope which is seen, is not hope; for* why does anyone hope for what he sees? 
8:25 But if we hope for what we do not see, <i>then</i> we are waiting for <i>it</i> through endurance.</p>
<br>
<p>8:26 Now likewise*, the Spirit is also jointly helping our weaknesses; for* we do not know what we are praying for, <i>that is</i> according to what is essential <i>for us</i>; but the Spirit himself is interceding on our behalf with unspeakable groans; 
8:27 and he who is searching the hearts knows what the mindset of the Spirit is, because he is interceding on behalf of the holy-ones according to <i>the will of</i> God. 
8:28 Now we know {F} that all things work together toward good, to those who love* God, to those who are called according to <i>his</i> purpose. 
8:29 Because, whom he knew beforehand, he also predetermined <i>to be</i> transformed to the image of his Son, *that* he himself might be the firstborn among many brethren; 
8:30 and whom he predetermined, he also called these and whom he called, he also justified these and whom he justified, he also glorified these.</p>
<br>
<p>8:31 Then* what will we say to these things? If God <i>is working</i> on our behalf, who <i>is</i> against us? 
8:32 He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up on behalf of us all, how will he not also grant to us all things together with him? 
8:33 Who shall accuse <i>anything</i> against God’s chosen? <i>It is</i> God who justifies. 
8:34 Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died, but also rather, who was also raised up from the dead, who is at the right <i>hand</i> of God, who also is interceding on our behalf.</p>
<p>8:35 Who will separate us from the love* of Christ? Shall affliction or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? 
8:36 Just-as it has been written, ‘Because of you we are slain the whole day. We were counted as sheep of <i>the</i> slaughter.’ {Psa 44:22} 
8:37 But we are victorious in all these things through him who loved* us. 
8:38 For* I have confidence, that neither death, nor life, nor messengers, nor principalities, nor powers, nor present things, nor future things, 
8:39 nor height, nor depth, nor some other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love* of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>{Footnotes: Rm 8:28: that to those who love* God, he is working all things toward good for those who are called according to <i>his</i> purpose.}</p>
<h3>Romans 9</h3>
<p>9:1 I say the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience <i>is</i> testifying together with me in the Holy Spirit, 
9:2 that I have great sorrow and constant anguish in my heart. 
9:3 For* I was praying that I myself were accursed from Christ on behalf of my brethren, my relatives according to the flesh, 
9:4 who are Israelites, whose <i>is</i> the sonship and the glory and the covenants* and the institution of the law and the divine service and the promises; 
9:5 whose are the fathers and from whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all: God <i>is</i> gracious* forever. Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>9:6 But <i>it is</i> not such-as that the word of God has fallen short. For* they <i>are</i> not all Israel, (those who <i>are</i> from Israel); 
9:7 nor, are they all children, because they are Abraham’s seed, but, ‘In Isaac your seed will be called.’ {Gen. 21:12} 
9:8 That is, the children of the flesh, these <i>are</i> not children of God, but the children of the promise are counted *for a seed. 
9:9 For* this is <i>the</i> word of promise, ‘I will come according to this season and Sarah will have a son.’ {Gen. 18:10} 
9:10 Now not only <i>so</i>, but also Rebecca having impregnation out of one, our father Isaac; 
9:11 for* <i>the children</i> not yet having been born, nor having practiced anything good or evil, that* the purpose of God according to <i>his</i> choice might stand, not from works, but from him who is calling. 
9:12 It was said to her, ‘The greater will serve* the inferior.’ {Gen. 25:23} 
9:13 Just-as it has been written, ‘Jacob I loved*, but Esau I hated.’ {Mal. 1:2,3}</p>
<br>
<p>9:14 Then* what shall we say? There is not unrighteousness with God, is there? Let it not happen! 
9:15 For* he says to Moses, ‘I will show-mercy to whomever I show-mercy and I will have pity on whomever I have pity.’ {Ex. 33:19} 
9:16 Then* consequently*, <i>it is</i> not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of him who shows-mercy– God. 
9:17 For* the Scripture says to Pharaoh, ‘I have lifted you up *for this same thing, *that I might show in you my power and *that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.’ {Ex. 9:16} 
9:18 Then* consequently*, he shows-mercy on whom he wills and he hardens whom he wills.</p>
<br>
<p>9:19 Therefore you will say to me, Why is he still finding-fault? For* who is standing against his will? 
9:20 But-rather, O man, who are you who answers back against God? The molded thing will not say to him who molded <i>it</i>, why did you make* me so, will it? 
9:21 Or does the potter not have authority over the clay, to make* out of the same batch one vessel *for honor and another *for dishonor? 
9:22 But <i>what</i> if God, willing to show his wrath and to make his power known, carried <i>us,</i> vessels of wrath having been framed *for destruction, in much patience; 
9:23 and that* he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand *for glory, 
9:24 whom he also invited, not only from the Jews, but also from the Gentiles?</p>
<p>9:25 As he says also in Hosea, ‘I will call those who <i>are</i> not my people, my people, and those not beloved, beloved.’{Ho. 2:23} 
9:26 And it will be, in the place where it was said to them, ‘You* <i>are</i> not my people; they will be called sons of the living God there.’ {Ho. 1:10} 
9:27 Now Isaiah cries on behalf of Israel, ‘If the number of the sons of Israel is like the sand of the sea, <i>only</i> the remnant will be saved; 
9:28 for* <i>he is</i> completing and cutting-short the word in righteousness because having been cut-short, the Lord will make* the word upon the earth.’ {Isa 10:22, 23} 
9:29 And, just-as Isaiah has said before, ‘If the Lord of Hosts had not left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom and would have been similar to Gomorrah.’ {Isa 1:9}</p>
<p>9:30 Then* what shall we say? That the Gentiles, who were not pursuing righteousness, grabbed righteousness, even the righteousness from faith. 
9:31 But Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not attain <i>the</i> law of righteousness. 
9:32 Why? Because <i>it was</i> not from faith, but as <i>it was</i> from works of <i>the</i> law, for* they stumbled <i>on</i> the stone of stumbling; 
9:33 just-as it has been written, ‘Behold, I place a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense in Zion and everyone who believes on him will not be ashamed.’ {Isa 
8:14 &amp; 28:16}</p>
<h3>Romans 10</h3>
<p>10:1 Brethren, indeed the delight of my heart and my supplication to God on behalf of Israel, is *for <i>their</i> salvation. 
10:2 For* I testify of them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to full knowledge. 
10:3 For* being ignorant of God’s righteousness and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. 
10:4 For* Christ <i>is</i> the end of <i>the</i> law *for righteousness to everyone who believes. 
10:5 For* Moses writes <i>of</i> the righteousness which <i>is</i> from the law, ‘That the man who practices those things will live by them.’ {Lev. 
18:5 Ezek. 20:11} 
10:6 But the righteousness which is from faith says thus, ‘Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?’ (That is, to bring* Christ down.) 
10:7 Or, ‘Who will come down into the abyss?’ (That is, to bring* Christ up from <i>among the</i> dead.) 
10:8 But what does it say? ‘The declaration is near you, in your mouth and in your heart.’ {Deu. 30:12-14?} That is the declaration of the faith which we are preaching: 
10:9 that if you confessed <i>the</i> Lord Jesus in your mouth and <i>if you</i> have believed in your heart that God raised him <i>up</i> from the dead, you will be saved; 
10:10 for* it is believed in the heart toward righteousness and it is confessed with the mouth toward salvation. 
10:11 For* the Scripture says, ‘Everyone who believes on him will not be ashamed.’ {Isa 28:16} 
10:12 For* there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for* the same <i>Lord is</i> Lord of all and is rich to all who are calling upon him; 
10:13 for* everyone, ‘Whomever calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.’ {Joel 2:32} 
10:14 Then* how will they call upon <i>him</i> in whom they have not believed? But how will they believe in him whom they have not heard? But how will they hear without <i>someone</i> preaching? 
10:15 But how will they preach, if they are not sent? Just-as it has been written, ‘Beautiful are the feet of those who are proclaiming the good-news of peace <i>and</i> of those who are proclaiming the good-news of good things!’ {Isa 52:7}</p>
<br>
<p>10:16 But not all obeyed* the good-news; for* Isaiah says, ‘Lord, who has believed our report?’ {Isa 53:1} 
10:17 Consequently*, the faith <i>comes</i> from <i>our</i> report but <i>our</i> report <i>comes</i> through <i>the</i> declaration of God. 
10:18 But I am saying, ‘Did they not hear?’ But-rather, ‘Their sounds went out into all the earth and their declarations to the ends of the inhabited-earth.’ {Psa 19:4} 
10:19 But I am saying, Did Israel not know? First Moses says, ‘I will provoke you* to jealousy upon <i>what is</i> no nation. I will rouse you* to anger upon a nation which has no understanding.’ {Deu. 32:21} 
10:20 Now Isaiah is very daring and says, ‘I was found by those who are not seeking me. I became manifest to those who are not asking for me.’ {Isa 65:1} 
10:21 But he says to Israel, ‘The whole day, I outstretched my hands to a disobedient and contradicting people.’ {Isa 65:2}</p>
<h3>Romans 11</h3>
<p>11:1 Therefore I say, God has not thrust away his people, has he? Let it not happen! For* I am also an Israelite, from the seed of Abraham, from <i>the</i> tribe of Benjamin. 
11:2 God did not thrust away his people which he knew beforehand. Or do you* not know what the Scripture says of Elijah? How he petitions God against Israel, saying, 
11:3 ‘Lord, they have killed your prophets and have made ruins of your altars, and I am left alone and they are seeking my life.’ {1Ki. 19:10,14} 
11:4 But what does the divine-answer say to him? ‘I have left to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.’ {1Ki. 19:18} 
11:5 So also, then* in this current time there has also become a remnant according to the chosen of grace. 
11:6 But if <i>it is</i> by grace, <i>it is</i> no more from works, otherwise grace becomes grace no more. But if from works, no more is it grace; otherwise work is work no more. 
11:7 Then* what? What Israel is seeking after, this it did not obtain, but the chosen obtained <i>it</i> and the rest were hardened; 
11:8 just-as it has been written, ‘God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that* they should not see and ears that* they should not hear, until this very day.’ {Isa 29:10} 
11:9 And David says, ‘Let their table become a snare and a trap and an offense and a repayment to them. 
11:10 Let their eyes be darkened that* they might not see and always bow down their backs.’{Psa 69:22-23}</p>
<br>
<p>11:11 Therefore I say, They have not tripped that* they might fall, have they? Let it not happen! But salvation <i>has come</i> to the Gentiles by their trespass, *that* they might provoke them to jealousy. 
11:12 Now if their trespass is <i>the</i> riches of <i>the</i> world and their loss <i>is</i>  the riches of the Gentiles; how much more <i>is</i> their fullness? 
11:13 For* I speak to you* who are Gentiles, inasmuch as I am indeed an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my service; 
11:14 if somehow I provoke to jealousy <i>those who are</i> my flesh and might save some out of them. 
11:15 For* if the casting away of them <i>is</i> the reconciling of the world, what <i>will</i> the receiving <i>of them be</i>, except life from <i>the</i> dead?</p>
<p>11:16 Now if the first-fruit <i>is</i> holy, so <i>is</i> the batch and if the root <i>is</i> holy, so <i>are</i> the branches. 
11:17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became a fellow partner of the root and of the plumpness of the olive tree <i>among them</i>. 
11:18 Do not boast against the branches, but if are you boasting against <i>them</i>, <i>it is</i> not you who is bearing the root, but the root <i>which is bearing</i> you. 
11:19 Therefore you will say, Branches were broken off, that* I might be grafted in. 
11:20 Well; they were broken off by their unbelief but you are standing in the faith. Do not be cavalier, but fear; 
11:21 for* if God did not spare the natural branches, lest neither will he spare you. 
11:22 Therefore, behold the kindness and severity of God, indeed toward those who fell; <i>it is</i> severity <i>upon them</i>, but kindness upon you, if you remain in the kindness <i>of God</i>: otherwise you also will be cut off. 
11:23 And also those, if they do not remain in their unbelief will be grafted in; for* God is able to graft them in again. 
11:24 For* if you were cut off from what is according to nature a wild olive tree and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more will these, which are the natural <i>branches</i>, be grafted into their own olive tree?</p>
<br>
<p>11:25 For* brethren, I do not wish you* to be ignorant of this mystery (that* you* may not be <i>too</i> prudent with yourselves), that a hardening has become partially to Israel, till the fullness of the Gentiles should come in; 
11:26 and all Israel will thus be saved; just-as it has been written, ‘There will come out of Zion, he who rescues and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob. 
11:27 And this <i>is</i> my covenant* to them, whenever I take away their sins.’ {Isa 59:20-21, 27:9} 
11:28 <i>They are</i> indeed enemies because of you* according to the good-news, but according to the choice, <i>they are</i> beloved because of the fathers. 
11:29 For* the gifts* and the calling of God <i>are</i> unregrettable. 
11:30 For* just-as you* were also previously disobedient to God, but now you* have been shown-mercy by their disobedience, 
11:31 so now these also were disobedient to your* mercy, that* they might also be shown-mercy. 
11:32 For* God has locked up together all to disobedience, that* he might show-mercy upon all.</p>
<br>
<p>11:33 O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable <i>are</i> his judgments and untraceable his ways! 
11:34 For* who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has become his counselor? 
11:35 Or who has first-given to him and it will be repaid to him <i>again?</i> 
11:36 <i>It is</i> because all things <i>are</i> from him and through him and to him. To him <i>is</i> the glory forever. Amen.</p>
<h3>Romans 12</h3>
<p>12:1 Therefore brethren, I am encouraging you* through the mercies from God, to present your* bodies <i>as</i> a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, <i>which is</i> your* logical divine service. 
12:2 And not to fashion yourselves to this age, but be transfigured <i>by</i> the renewal of your* mind, *that* you* may be proving <i>in</i> you what <i>is</i> the will of God: the good and acceptable and mature.</p>
<br>
<p>12:3 For* I say, through the grace which was given to me, to everyone who is among you*, not to have high-notions beyond what he ought to be mindful of. But to be mindful of <i>this grace</i>, *that* he should be sensible, just-as God has divided to each one a measure of faith. 
12:4 For* just-as we have many members in one body, and all the members do not have the same function; 
12:5 so we, the many, are one body in Christ, and every one members of one another. 
12:6 Now having assorted gifts* according to the grace which was given to us; if prophecy, <i>then prophesy</i> according to the analogy of the faith; 
12:7 if service, <i>give yourselves</i> to the service; if he who is teaching, to the teaching; 
12:8 if he who is encouraging, to the encouragement; he who is giving, <i>do</i> in liberality; he who is governing, <i>do</i> with* diligence; he who is showing-mercy to <i>others</i>, <i>do</i> with* joyfulness.</p>
<br>
<p>12:9 <i>Let</i> the love* <i>be</i> non-pretended, abhorring evil things, joining yourselves to the good things. 
12:10 <i>Be</i> tenderly loving to one another in <i>the</i> love of the brethren; be the leader for one another in honor; 
12:11 not lazy in diligence <i>but</i> zealous in spirit; serving* the Lord; 
12:12 rejoicing in hope; enduring in affliction; persevering in prayer; 
12:13 sharing in the needs of the holy-ones; pursuing hospitality. 
12:14 Speak well of those who are persecuting you*; speak well and do not curse. 
12:15 Rejoice with those who are rejoicing and weep with those who are weeping. 
12:16 Be mindful of the same things toward one another. Do not be mindful of the exalted things, but involve yourself with the humble. Do not become <i>too</i> prudent with yourselves. 
12:17 Give to no one evil in exchange-for evil. Plan-for good things in the sight of all men. 
12:18 If possible, what <i>is</i> from you <i>should</i> be at peace with all men.</p>
<p>12:19 Beloved, <i>do</i> not <i>be</i> avenging yourselves, but give a chance for the wrath <i>of God</i>; for* it has been written, ‘Vengeance <i>is</i> for me. I will repay, says the Lord.’ {Deu. 32:25} 
12:20 Therefore, if your enemy hungers, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for* in doing this, you will pile up hot-coals of fire upon his head. 
12:21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with* good.</p>
<h3>Romans 13</h3>
<p>13:1 Let every soul be subject to the authorities which are superior to <i>him</i>; for* there is no authority if not from God, and the authorities which are, have been appointed by God. 
13:2 So-then, he who is resisting the authority is standing against the commandment of God, and those who are standing against <i>it</i> will receive judgment for themselves. 
13:3 For* rulers are not a terror to the good works, but to the evil <i>works</i>. And you do not wish to be afraid of the authority, do you? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; 
13:4 for* he is a servant of God to you *for good. But if you practice evil, be afraid; for* he is not wearing the sword vainly; for* he is a servant of God, an avenger *for wrath to him who is practicing evil. 
13:5 Hence, <i>it is</i> a necessity to be subject <i>to him</i>, not only because of the wrath, but also because of conscience. 
13:6 For* you* are also paying taxes because of this; for* they are ministers* of God, persevering *for this same thing. 
13:7 Therefore give to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute; tax to whom tax; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.</p>
<br>
<p>13:8 Owe nothing to anyone, except to love* one another; for* he who loves* the other has fulfilled the law. 
13:9 For* this, ‘Do not commit adultery; Do not murder; Do not steal; Do not covet, and if there is some other commandment in this word, it is summed up in this: ‘You will love* your neighbor like yourself.’ {Ex. 20:13-15, 17; Lev. 19:18} 
13:10 Love* works no ill to his neighbor. Therefore, love* <i>is the</i> fulfillment of the law.</p>
<br>
<p>13:11 Also this, knowing the time, that <i>it is</i> already <i>the</i> hour we should arise from sleep; for* now salvation is nearer to us than when we <i>first</i> believed. 
13:12 The night has progressed, and the day has drawn near. Therefore, we should place away from ourselves the works of darkness, and should clothe ourselves with the weapons of light. 
13:13 We should walk decently, like in the day; not in revelings and drunkenness, not in sleeping-around and unbridled-lusts, not in strife and jealousy. 
13:14 But clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not practice forethought *for the lusts of the flesh.</p>
<br>
<h3>Romans 14</h3>
<p>14:1 But receive him who is weak in the faith, <i>yet</i> not *for the discerning <i>which comes</i> from reasonings. 
14:2 One believes may eat all things, but the one who is weak eats herbs. 
14:3 Do not let him who eats, scorn him who does not eat; and do not let him who does not eat, judge him who eats; for* God himself has received him. 
14:4 Who are you who is judging another’s domestic <i>servant</i>? He stands or falls to his own lord. Now, he will be <i>able to</i> stand; for* God is able to stand him <i>up</i>. 
14:5 One indeed is judging a day above <i>another</i> day; but one is judging each day <i>the same</i>; let each one be fully assured in his own mind. 
14:6 He who is mindful of the day, is mindful of it to the Lord; and he who is not mindful of the day, is not mindful of it to the Lord; and he who eats, eats to the Lord, for* he gives-thanks to God. And he who does not eat, he does not eat to the Lord, and gives-thanks to God. 
14:7 For* none of us is living to himself, and none dies to himself. 
14:8 For* <i>in</i> both, if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord; therefore, <i>in</i> both, if we live or die, we are the Lord’s. 
14:9 For* Christ both died and rose* up and lived *for this, that* he might have lordship over both the dead and the living. 
14:10 But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you scorn your brother? For* we will all stand-before the judicial-seat of Christ. 
14:11 For* it has been written, ‘<i>As</i> I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will confess to God.’ {Isa 45:23} 
14:12 Then* consequently*, each of us will give an account concerning himself to God.</p>
<br>
<p>14:13 Therefore we should judge one another no longer, but rather judge this: <i>you are</i> not to place a stumbling block, or offense, in <i>the way of</i> the brother. 
14:14 I know, and have confidence in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is desecrated through itself, except to him who counts something to be desecrated, to that <i>one it is</i> desecrated. 
14:15 But if your brother is made sorrowful because of food, you no longer walk according to love*. Do not destroy that <i>man</i>, on behalf of whom Christ died, with your food. 
14:16 Then* do not let your* good be blasphemed; 
14:17 for* the kingdom of God is not <i>about</i> food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 
14:18 For* he who is serving* Christ in these things is well pleasing to God and approved by men. 
14:19 Then* consequently*, we may pursue the things of peace, and the things for building up one another. 
14:20 Do not tear-down the work of God because of food. All things indeed are clean, but <i>it is</i> evil to that man who eats through a stumbling block. 
14:21 It is good not to eat meat, nor to drink wine, nor <i>anything</i> in which your brother stumbles or is offended or is weak. 
14:22 Do you have faith? Have it to yourself in God’s sight! He who is not judging himself in what he is approving, is fortunate. 
14:23 But he who is doubting has been condemned if he eats, because <i>he does</i> not <i>eat</i> out of faith, and whatever is not from faith is sin.</p>
<br>
<p>14:24 Now to him who is able to establish you* according to my good-news, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, having been kept-silent in times everlasting, 
14:25 but now, having been manifested, and through the prophetic Scriptures, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, is made known to all the nations, into <i>the</i> obedience of <i>the</i> faith; 
14:26 to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ: to whom <i>is</i> the glory forever. Amen.</p>
<h3>Romans 15</h3>
<p>15:1 Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the powerless and not to please ourselves. 
15:2 Let each of us please his neighbor *for what is good toward building <i>him</i> up. 
15:3 For* also Christ did not please himself, but, as it has been written, ‘The reproaches of those who are reproaching you fell upon me.’ {Psa 69:9} 
15:4 For* as many things as were written beforehand were written *for our instruction, in order that through endurance and through encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. 
15:5 Now the God of endurance and encouragement gives to you* to be mindful of the same thing among one another according to Christ Jesus, 
15:6 that* you* may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ united with* one mouth. 
15:7 Hence receive one another, just-as Christ also received you*, to the glory of God. 
15:8 But I am saying that Christ Jesus has become a servant of the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God, *that* he might confirm the promises <i>given</i> to the fathers, 
15:9 and that the Gentiles might glorify God on behalf of his mercy; as it has been written, ‘Because of this, I will profess you among the Gentiles and sing-praise to your name.’ {Psa 18:49} 
15:10 And again he says, ‘Gentiles be joyous with his people.’ {Deu. 32:43} 
15:11 And again, ‘Praise the Lord, all the Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise him.’ {Psa 117:1} 
15:12 And again, Isaiah says, ‘There will be the root of Jesse and he who rises* up to rule over the Gentiles; upon him the Gentiles will hope.’ {Isa 11:1, 10} 
15:13 Now the God of hope may fill you* with all joy and peace in believing, *that* you* may abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>15:14 And my brethren, I also have confidence in myself concerning you*, that you* yourselves are full of goodness, having been filled with all knowledge, also able to admonish one another. 
15:15 But I write more-daringly to you* brethren individually, as reminding you* again, because of the grace which was given to me by God, 
15:16 *that* I might be a minister* of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, doing the sacred work of the good-news of God, that* the offering up of the Gentiles might become acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>15:17 Therefore, I have my boasting in Christ Jesus <i>in</i> the things pertaining to God. 
15:18 For* I will not dare to speak of anything except those which Christ worked through me, *for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and works, 
15:19 in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God. So-then, I have fulfilled the good-news of Christ from Jerusalem and the surrounding <i>area</i>, as far as Illyricum. 
15:20 And so, <i>I am</i> making it my aim to proclaim the good-news, not where Christ was <i>already</i> named, that* I might not build upon another’s foundation; 
15:21 but, as it has been written, ‘They will see, to whom it was not reported concerning him. And those who have not heard will understand.’ {Isa 52:15}</p>
<br>
<p>15:22 Hence also, I was being hindered these many <i>times</i> from coming to you*, 
15:23 but now, having no longer a place in these districts and having a longing to come to you* from many years <i>ago</i>. 
15:24 Like whenever I travel through toward Spain, I will come to you*, (for* I am hoping to see you* when* I am going through and to be sent onward by you*, if first individually from you*, <i>that</i> I should be filled,)– 
15:25 but now, I am traveling to Jerusalem, serving the holy-ones. 
15:26 For* Macedonia and Achaia were delighted to make* a certain generosity to the poor among the holy-ones who are in Jerusalem. 
15:27 For* they were delighted and they are their debtors. For* if the Gentiles have been sharing in the spiritual things of them, they owe it <i>to them</i> also to minister* to them in fleshly things. 
15:28 Therefore, when* I have completed this and have sealed this fruit for them, I will go into Spain through you*. 
15:29 Now I know that, when* I come to you*, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the good-news of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>15:30 Now brethren, I am encouraging you* through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love* of the Spirit, that you* struggle together with me, <i>and</i> on my behalf in your* prayers to God; 
15:31 that* I may be rescued from the disobedient <i>who are</i> in Judea and that* my service which <i>I have</i> *for Jerusalem might become acceptable to the holy-ones; 
15:32 that* I may come to you* in joy through the will of God and I may rest together with you*. 
15:33 Now the God of peace <i>be</i> with you* all. Amen.</p>
<h3>Romans 16</h3>
<p>16:1 I commend to you* Phoebe our sister, who is a servant <i>of my needs</i> from the congregation* in Cenchreae: 
16:2 that* you* should accept her in the Lord, worthy of the holy-ones, and <i>that*</i> you* should stand beside her in whatever she has need from you*. For* she herself has also become an assistant of many, and of me myself.</p>
<br>
<p>16:3 Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, 
16:4 who have risked their own neck on behalf of my life; whom I not only give-thanks, but also all the congregations* of the Gentiles; 
16:5 and <i>greet</i> the congregation* <i>who is</i> in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first-fruit of Achaia to Christ. 
16:6 Greet Mary, who labored much *for us. 
16:7 Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives and my fellow captives, who are notable <i>even</i> among the apostles, who has also happened <i>to be</i> in Christ before me. 
16:8 Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord. 
16:9 Greet Urbanus our fellow worker in Christ and Stachys my beloved. 
16:10 Greet Apelles, the approved, in Christ. Greet those who are from the <i>household</i> of Aristobulus. 
16:11 Greet Herodion my relative. Greet those of the <i>household</i> of Narcissus, that are in the Lord. 
16:12 Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who are laboring in the Lord. Greet Persis the beloved, who labored much in the Lord. 
16:13 Greet Rufus, the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 
16:14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Hermas, Patrobas and the brethren who are together with them. 
16:15 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the holy-ones who are together with them. 
16:16 Greet one another with* a holy kiss. The congregations* of Christ greet you*.</p>
<br>
<p>16:17 Now brethren, I am encouraging you*, note those who are the <i>cause of</i> dissensions and offenses contrary to the teaching which you* learned <i>and are</i>  practicing, and shun away from them. 
16:18 For* such are not serving* our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly, and they are deceiving the hearts of the guiltless through their smooth-talk and blessings.</p>
<p>16:19 For* your* obedience has reached out to all men. Therefore I rejoice over you*, but I wish for you* to be indeed wise <i>as</i> to <i>what is</i> good, and harmless to <i>what is</i> evil. 
16:20 Now the God of peace will crush the Adversary under your* feet shortly.</p>
<br>
<p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with* you*.</p>
<br>
<p>16:21 Timothy my fellow worker greets you*, and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my relatives. 
16:22 I Tertius, who writes <i>this</i> letter, greet you* in <i>the</i> Lord. 
16:23 Gaius greets you*, my host and of the whole congregation*. Erastus the steward of the city greets you* and Quartus the brother. 
16:24 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with all of you*. Amen.</p>

<h3>1 Corinthians 1</h3>
<p>1:1 Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother, 
1:2 to the congregation* of God which is in Corinth– those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called holy-ones, together with all who are calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours: 
1:3 grace to you* and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>1:4 I am always giving-thanks to my God concerning you*, for the grace of God which was given to you* in Christ Jesus; 
1:5 that you* were enriched in him in everything, in all speech and all knowledge; 
1:6 just-as the testimony of Christ was steadfast in you*; 
1:7 so-that you* are lacking in no gift*; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1:8 who will also confirm you* until the end, <i>so that you</i>* <i>are</i> irreproachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1:9 God is faithful, through whom you* were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>1:10 Now brethren, I am pleading with you* through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that* you* all should speak the same thing and there should be no splits among you*, but you* should be framed <i>together</i> in the same mind and in the same viewpoint. 
1:11 For* it has been indicated to me concerning you*, my brethren, by the <i>household</i> of Chloe, that strifes are among you*. 
1:12 Now I am saying this, that each of you* says, I am indeed of Paul! I <i>am indeed</i> of Apollos! I <i>am indeed</i> of Cephas! I <i>am indeed</i> of Christ!</p>
<p>1:13 Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified on your* behalf, was he? Or were you* immersed* into the name of Paul? 
1:14 I thank God that I immersed* none of you*, except Crispus and Gaius; 
1:15 lest anyone might say that you* were immersed* into my name. 
1:16 And I also immersed* the household of Stephanas; furthermore, I do not know if I immersed* any other. 
1:17 For* Christ sent me not to immerse*, but to proclaim the good-news; not in wisdom of words, (that* the cross of Christ might not be made void).</p>
<br>
<p>1:18 For* the word of the cross is indeed foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God. 
1:19 For* it has been written, ‘I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will reject the understanding of the intelligent <i>ones</i>.’ {Isa 29:14, Psa 33:10} 
1:20 Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this world? Has God not made the wisdom of the world foolish? 
1:21 For* since, in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know God, it delighted God through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe. 
1:22 Since both Jews ask for a sign and Greeks seek wisdom; 
1:23 but we preach Christ <i>as</i> having been crucified, indeed an offense to <i>the</i> Jews, but foolishness to <i>the</i> Greeks; 
1:24 but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ <i>is</i> the power of God and the wisdom of God. 
1:25 Because the foolish things of God are wiser than men, and the weakness of God is mightier than men.</p>
<br>
<p>1:26 For* you* see your calling brethren, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble. 
1:27 But God chose the foolish things of the world, that* he might shame the wise, and God chose the weak things of the world, that* he might shame the strong; 
1:28 and God chose the ignoble things of the world and the things that have been scorned and the things that are not, in order that he might do-away-with the things that are; 
1:29 *that no flesh might boast in God’s sight. 
1:30 But you* are from him, in Christ Jesus, who has become to us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption from God; 
1:31 that*, as it has been written, ‘He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.’ {Jer. 9:24}</p>
<h3>1 Corinthians 2</h3>
<p>2:1 And brethren, when* I came to you* proclaiming the testimony of God to you*, I did not come according to superiority of speech or of wisdom. 
2:2 For* I decided not to know anything among you*, except Jesus Christ and him having been crucified. 
2:3 And I happened to <i>be with</i> you* in weakness and in fear, and in much trembling. 
2:4 And my speech and my preaching was not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in <i>the</i> demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 
2:5 in order that your* faith should not be in the wisdom of men, but <i>be</i> in the power of God.</p>
<br>
<p>2:6 Now we are speaking wisdom among those who are mature; yet a wisdom not of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are being done-away-with; 
2:7 but we are speaking God’s wisdom in a mystery, the <i>wisdom</i> that has been hidden, which God predetermined before the ages, *for our glory. 
2:8 <i>It is this mystery</i> which none of the rulers of this world knew; for* if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory; 
2:9 but as it has been written, ‘Things which <i>the</i> eye did not see and <i>the</i> ear did not hear and <i>things which</i> did not enter into the heart of man, which God prepared for those who love* him.’ {Isa 64:4}</p>
<p>2:10 But God revealed <i>them</i> to us through his Spirit; for* the Spirit is searching all things, even the depths of God. 
2:11 For* who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? So also, the things of God no one knows, except the Spirit of God. 
2:12 But we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the {F} Spirit who is from God; that* we might know the things which were granted to us by God. 
2:13 We also speak these things, not in <i>the</i> taught things from mankind, in words of wisdom, but in <i>the</i> taught things from the Holy Spirit; combining together with spiritual <i>words,</i> spiritual things<i>.</i></p>
<p>2:14 Now <i>the</i> physical man does not accept the things from the Spirit of God; for* they are foolishness to him, and he is not able to know <i>them</i>, because they are spiritually examined. 
2:15 But he who is spiritual is indeed examining all things, but he himself is examined by no one. 
2:16 For* who has known the mind of the Lord, who will lecture him? But we have the mind of Christ.</p>

<h3>1 Corinthians 3</h3>
<p>3:1 And brethren, I was not able to speak to you* as to spiritual <i>people</i>, but as to fleshly <i>ones</i>, as to infants in Christ. 
3:2 I gave you* milk to drink and not food, for* you* were not able <i>to eat it.</i> Neither are you* able even now, 
3:3 for* you* are still fleshly. For* where there is jealousy and strife and dissensions among you*, are you* not fleshly, and are you* not walking according to <i>the manner of</i> man?</p>
<p>3:4 For* whenever someone says, I am indeed of Paul, but a different <i>one</i>, I <i>am</i> of Apollos, are you* not fleshly? 
3:5 Therefore, who is Paul? And who is Apollos? But servants through whom you* believed, and each as the Lord gave to him. 
3:6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth. 
3:7 So-then neither is he who is planting anything, nor he who is watering, but God who is causing the growth. 
3:8 Now the one who is planting and the one who is watering are one, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. 
3:9 For* we are God’s fellow workers. You* are God’s cultivation, God’s building.</p>
<br>
<p>3:10 According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise expert-builder, I have laid a foundation, and another is building upon <i>it</i>. But let each <i>one</i> beware how he is building upon <i>it</i>. 
3:11 For* no one is able to lay another foundation beside what is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
3:12 But if anyone is building on this foundation <i>with</i> gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw, 
3:13 the work of each <i>one</i> will become apparent. For* the day will indicate it, because it is revealed in fire, and the fire will test the work of each <i>one</i>, of what sort it is. 
3:14 If anyone’s work remains which he built upon <i>it</i>, he will receive a reward. 
3:15 If the work of anyone will be burned, he will forfeit <i>that work</i>, but he himself will be saved, but so as through fire.</p>
<br>
<p>3:16 Do you* not know that you* are a temple of God and the Spirit of God is dwelling in you*? 
3:17 If anyone corrupts the temple of God, God will have corruption <i>for</i> him; for* the temple of God is holy, and such are you*.</p>
<br>
<p>3:18 Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise in this world among you*, let him become foolish, in order that he may become wise. 
3:19 For* the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For* it has been written, ‘<i>It is</i> he who grabs the wise in their craftiness'; {Job 5:13} 
3:20 and again, ‘The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are futile.’ {Psa 94:11} 
3:21 So-then, let no one boast in men. For* all things are yours*, 
3:22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things that are present, or future things. All things are yours*, 
3:23 and you* are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.</p>
<h3>1 Corinthians 4</h3>
<p>4:1 So let a man count us as attendants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. 
4:2 But furthermore, it is required in stewards, that* someone should be found faithful. 
4:3 But <i>it is</i> at <i>the</i> least <i>concern</i> to me, that* I might be judged by you* or by a human <i>judgment</i> day. But I am not <i>even</i> judging myself. 
4:4 For* I have been conscious of nothing in myself, but I have not been justified by this. But he who is judging me is the Lord. 
4:5 So-then, do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord should come, who will both illuminate the hidden things of darkness and will manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then the praise from God will happen for each.</p>
<br>
<p>4:6 Now brethren, I fashioned these things to myself and Apollos because of you*; in order that you* may learn in us not to have a mindset <i>to go</i> beyond what has been written; that* no one should be arrogant on behalf of one against the other. 
4:7 For* who is making <i>you</i> the judge? But what do you have that you did not receive? But if you also received <i>it</i>, why are you boasting as <i>if</i> you did not receive <i>it</i>? 
4:8 Already you* are satisfied, already you* were enriched, you* reigned without us, and yet, I wish-that you* did yet reign, that* we also might reign together with you*. 
4:9 For* I think that God has showed us, the apostles, last of all, as men doomed to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to messengers and men. 
4:10 We <i>are</i> foolish because of Christ, but you* <i>are</i> prudent in Christ. We <i>are</i> weak, but you* <i>are</i> strong. You* <i>are</i> glorious, but we <i>are</i> dishonored. 
4:11 We both are hungry and thirsty, even to this current hour, and are naked and are battered and are homeless; 
4:12 and we are laboring, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we speak well of <i>them</i>; being persecuted, we are tolerating <i>it</i>; 
4:13 being blasphemed, we are encouraging. We have become like the scum of the world, the garbage of all things, even until now.</p>
<br>
<p>4:14 I am not writing these things <i>to be</i> embarrassing you*, but I am admonishing <i>you*</i> as my beloved children. 
4:15 For* <i>even</i> if you* have ten thousand tutors in Christ, but <i>you</i>* <i>do</i> not <i>have</i> many fathers, for* I fathered you* in Christ Jesus through the good-news. 
4:16 Therefore I am encouraging you*. Become imitators of me. 
4:17 Because of this, I have sent Timothy to you*, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you* of my ways, the <i>ones</i> in Christ, just-as I am teaching everywhere in every congregation*. 
4:18 Now some are arrogant as <i>though</i> I was not coming to you*. 
4:19 But I will come to you* shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the speech of those who have been arrogant, but the power. 
4:20 For* the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power. 
4:21 What do you* wish? Should I come to you* with* a rod, or in love* and a spirit of meekness?</p>
<h3>1 Corinthians 5</h3>
<p>5:1 Fornication is heard literally <i>to be</i> among you* (and such fornication which is not even named among the Gentiles), that someone has his father’s wife. 
5:2 And you* have been arrogant, and did not rather mourn that* he who did this work might be taken away out of your* midst. 
5:3 For* indeed, as being absent in body, but being present* in spirit, I have already judged him thus, who has worked this, (as <i>though</i> I were present*), 
5:4 in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. When* you* and my spirit are gathered together with the power of our Lord Jesus, 
5:5 to give such a one to the Adversary *for the utter-ruin of the flesh, that* the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>5:6 Your* boasting is not good. Do you* not know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch? 
5:7 Clean out the old leaven, that* you* may be a new batch, just-as you* are unleavened. For* Christ our Passover has also been sacrificed on our behalf. 
5:8 So-then we should celebrate the festival, not in old leaven, nor in the leaven of malice and wickedness, but in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
<br>
<p>5:9 I have written to you* in my letter not to socialize together with fornicators; 
5:10 and certainly not <i>meaning</i> with the fornicators of this world or with the greedy or swindlers or idolaters; otherwise, you* are consequently* obligated to go forth out of the world. 
5:11 But now, I have written to you* not to socialize together with anyone who is named a brother, if <i>he is</i> either a fornicator or greedy, or an idolater or a reviler, or a drunkard or a swindler; do not even eat together with such <i>a person.</i> 
5:12 For* what <i>is it</i> to me to judge those who are outside? Do you* not judge those who are inside? 
5:13 But God will judge those who are outside, and you will take away the evil man from <i>among</i> yourselves.</p>
<h3>1 Corinthians 6</h3>
<p>6:1 Does anyone of you* dare, having a matter <i>of strife</i> toward the other, go to court in front of the unrighteous and not in front of the holy-ones? 
6:2 Or do you* not know that the holy-ones will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you*, are you* unworthy of the least of courts? 
6:3 Do you* not know that we will judge <i>the</i> messengers? Why not also the things <i>of</i> everyday life? 
6:4 Therefore, if you* indeed have courts <i>concerning</i> things of everyday life, <i>why</i> are you* seating those who have been scorned in the congregation* <i>as judges</i>? 
6:5 I am saying <i>this</i> to shame you*. So is there not one wise <i>person</i> among you*? Not even one who will be able to judge between his brethren? 
6:6 But brother is going to court with brother, and that in front of unbelievers! 
6:7 Therefore, <i>it is</i> indeed already a literal loss among you*, that you* have lawsuits with yourselves. Why not rather be defrauded? 
6:8 No, but you* yourselves do wrong and defraud, and <i>you* do</i> these things <i>to</i> brethren.</p>
<p>6:9 Or do you* not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor pedophiles, nor homosexuals, 
6:10 nor the greedy, nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. 
6:11 And some of you* were these, but you* were bathed, but you* were sanctified, but you* were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and in the Spirit of our God.</p>
<br>
<p>6:12 All things are legal for me, but not all things are advantageous. All things are legal for me, but I will not be brought-under the authority by anything. 
6:13 Foods <i>are</i> for the belly and the belly <i>is</i> for foods, but God will do-away-with both this and these. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</p>
<p>6:14 Now God both raised up the Lord and will be raising us up through his power. 
6:15 Do you* not know that your* bodies are members of Christ? Therefore, should I take away the members of Christ and make* them members of a prostitute? Let it not happen! 
6:16 Therefore, do you* not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For* he says, The two will become one flesh. {Gen. 2:24} 
6:17 But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. 
6:18 Flee fornication. Every sin, whatever a man practices, <i>is</i> outside the body, but he who fornicates sins toward his own body. 
6:19 Or do you* not know that your* body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you*, whom you* have from God? And you* are not your* own; 
6:20 for* you* were bought with a price. Glorify God in your* body and in your* spirit which is God’s!</p>
<h3>1 Corinthians 7</h3>
<p>7:1 Now concerning the things of which you* wrote to me: <i>it is</i> good for a man not to touch a woman <i>sexually.</i> 
7:2 But, because of fornications, let each <i>man</i> have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband. 
7:3 Let the husband give to the wife her owed benevolence and likewise also the wife to the husband. 
7:4 The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband, and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife. 
7:5 Do not deprive one another, lest from agreement for a season, that* you* may occupy yourselves to fasting and to prayer, and you* may come to the same again, in order that the Adversary may not tempt you* because of your* shortage of self-control. 
7:6 But I am saying this by concession, not by commandment. 
7:7 For* I wish that all men were even as I myself <i>am</i>. But each one has his own gift* from God, one so, but some thus.</p>
<br>
<p>7:8 But I am saying to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I <i>am</i>. 
7:9 But if they do not exercise self-control, let them marry; for* it is better to marry than to be on fire. 
7:10 But I command to those who have married, (not I, but the Lord): the wife is not to be separated from her husband, 
7:11 (but even if she is separated, let her remain unmarried, or let her be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband <i>is</i> not to leave his wife.</p>
<p>7:12 But to the rest I say, (not the Lord); if some brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to dwell with him, let him not leave her. 
7:13 And <i>if</i> a wife who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to dwell with her, let her not leave him. 
7:14 For* the unbelieving husband has been sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified by the husband. Consequently*, your* children were unclean, but now they are holy. 
7:15 Yet if the unbelieving <i>spouse</i> separates, let him separate; the brother or the sister has not been enslaved in such. Now God has called us in peace. 
7:16 For* what do you know O wife, if you will save your husband? Or what do you know O husband, if you will save your wife?</p>
<p>7:17 Except as God has divided to each <i>one</i>, as the Lord has called each, so let him walk. And so I myself am commanding in all the congregations*. 
7:18 Was anyone called being circumcised? Let him not be uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised. 
7:19 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. 
7:20 Let each <i>one</i> remain in that calling in which he was called. 
7:21 Were you called being a bondservant? Let it not be a care to you, but if you are also able to become free; use <i>it</i> rather. 
7:22 For* he who was called in the Lord, being a bondservant, is the Lord’s freedman; likewise, he who was called, being free, is Christ’s bondservant. 
7:23 You* were bought with a price; do not become bondservants of men. 
7:24 Brethren, let each <i>one</i> remain with God in what he was called.</p>
<br>
<p>7:25 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my viewpoint, as one who has been shown-mercy by the Lord to be faithful. 
7:26 Therefore I suppose this to be* good, because of the present necessity; that <i>it is</i> good for a man to be thus. 
7:27 Have you been bound to a wife? Do not seek divorce. Have you been loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife. 
7:28 But even if you marry, you have not sinned, and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet, such will have affliction in the flesh, and I <i>would</i> spare you*.</p>
<p>7:29 But I am saying this, brethren, the time is limited, that* furthermore, both those who have wives may be as <i>though</i> they had none; 
7:30 and those who weep, as <i>though</i> they did not weep, and those who rejoice, as <i>though</i> they did not rejoice, and those who buy, as <i>though</i> they did not have; 
7:31 and those who use this world, as <i>though</i> they did not make full use of <i>it</i>; for* the fashion of this world is passing away.</p>
<p>7:32 But I wish <i>for</i> you* to be carefree. He who is unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord, how he will please the Lord; 
7:33 but he who is married is anxious for the things of the world, how he may please his wife. 
7:34 He has been divided. The <i>unmarried</i> woman, (also the virgin), is anxious for the things <i>is</i> of the Lord, that* she may be holy both in body and in spirit, but she who is married is anxious for the things of the world, how she will please her husband. 
7:35 Now, I say this is advantageous for yourselves, not that* I may cast a noose upon you*, but *for what is decent, and that you* may be devoted to the Lord, non-distracted.</p>
<p>7:36 But if anyone supposes he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is beyond her prime and thus it ought to happen, let him do what he wills; he is not sinning; let them marry. 
7:37 But he who stands, grounded in his heart, having no necessity, but has the authority concerning his own will, and he has decided this in his own heart to keep his own virgin, he does well. 
7:38 So-then both he who betroths <i>his own virgin</i> does well, and he who does not betroth <i>his own virgin</i> is doing better.</p>
<p>7:39 A wife has been bound by law inasmuch time as her husband is living, but if the husband has fallen-asleep, she is free to be married to whom she wills<i>, but</i> only in the Lord. 
7:40 But she is fortunate if she remains so, according to my viewpoint, and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</p>
<h3>1 Corinthians 8</h3>
<p>8:1 Now concerning idol-sacrifices: we know that all have knowledge. Knowledge is arrogant, but love* builds up. 
8:2 But if anyone thinks to know anything, he has known nothing, yet like he ought to know; 
8:3 but if anyone loves* God, this one is known by him. 
8:4 Therefore concerning the food of idol-sacrifices, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no other God except one. 
8:5 For* if indeed* there are <i>so</i> called* gods, if in heaven or upon the earth; just-as there are many <i>such</i> gods and many <i>such</i> lords, 
8:6 but to us, <i>there is</i> one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we <i>are</i> *for him, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him. 
8:7 But that knowledge <i>is</i> not in all <i>people</i>, but some, until now, with the conscience of the idol, eat <i>it</i> like an idol-sacrifice, and their conscience is defiled, being weak. 
8:8 But food does not present us to God; for* neither if we eat, do we abound? Nor, if we do not eat, are we lacking?</p>
<p>8:9 But beware, lest this liberty of yours* might become a stumbling block to the weak. 
8:10 For* if anyone sees you, (you who has knowledge), reclining <i>at a table</i> in an idol’s sanctuary, will not his conscience, being weak, be built up, *that* he might eat idol-sacrifices? 
8:11 And the weak brother will perish on <i>the basis of</i> your knowledge, <i>but</i> Christ died because of him. 
8:12 Now thus, <i>by</i> sinning <i>directly</i> at the brethren and beating their weak conscience, you* are sinning <i>directly</i> at Christ. 
8:13 Hence, if food is offending my brother, I should never* eat <i>that</i> meat forever, that* I may not offend my brother.</p>
<h3>1 Corinthians 9</h3>
<p>9:1 Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you* not my work in the Lord? 
9:2 If I am not an apostle to others, but yet I am to you*; for* you* are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.</p>
<p>9:3 My defense to those who are examining me is this: 
9:4 have we no authority to eat and to drink? 
9:5 Have we no authority to lead around a wife, (a sister <i>in the Lord)</i>, even as the rest of the apostles and the brethren of the Lord and Cephas? 
9:6 Or <i>is it</i> only Barnabas and I <i>who</i> have no authority not to work? 
9:7 Does anyone ever make war <i>while supplying</i> his own rations? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat from its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not drink from the milk of the flock? 
9:8 I am not speaking these things according to human <i>standards</i>. Or is the law not also saying these things? 
9:9 For* it has been written in the Law of Moses, ‘You will not muzzle a threshing bull.’ {Deu. 25:4} Is there care of the bulls <i>only</i> with God? 
9:10 Or does he certainly say it because of us? For* it was written because of us, that the one who is plowing ought to plow in hope, and the one who is threshing <i>ought to thresh</i> in hope to partake of his hope.</p>
<p>9:11 If we sowed spiritual things to you*, is it a great thing if we will reap your* fleshly things? 
9:12 If others are partaking of <i>this</i> authority over you*, <i>do</i> we not yet more? But we did not use this authority, but we are forbearing all things, that* we should not give any hindrance to the good-news of Christ. 
9:13 Do you* not know that those who work <i>at</i> the sacred things, eat from <i>the things of</i> the temple, and those who wait-upon the altar have their part together with the altar? 
9:14 So, the Lord also commanded that those who are proclaiming the good-news, to live out of the good-news. 
9:15 But I used none of these things, and I do not write these things that* it may become so with* me; for* <i>it would be</i> good for me rather to die, than that* anyone should make my boasting void. 
9:16 For* if I proclaim the good-news, it is not boasting to me; for* necessity is laid upon me, but woe is to me, if I do not proclaim the good-news. 
9:17 For* if I am doing this voluntarily, I have a reward, but if <i>I do so</i> involuntarily, I have been entrusted <i>with</i> a stewardship. 
9:18 Then* what is my reward? That*, <i>in</i> proclaiming the good-news of the Christ without cost, I might place the good-news <i>before you</i>*, <i>and</i> *that* I should not make full use of my authority in the good-news.</p>
<p>9:19 For* <i>although</i> {F} I was free from all<i>,</i> I enslaved myself to all, in order that I might gain <i>all</i> the more. 
9:20 And I became like a Jew to the Jews, in order that I might gain Jews. <i>I became</i> like <i>those</i> under <i>the</i> law to those <i>who are</i> under <i>the</i> law, in order that I might gain those <i>who are</i> under <i>the</i> law. 
9:21 <i>I became</i> to those <i>who are</i> lawless, like <i>the</i> lawless, (not being lawless to God, but lawful to Christ), in order that I might gain those <i>who are</i> lawless. 
9:22 I became like the weak to those <i>who are</i> weak, in order that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, in order that I may certainly save some. 
9:23 But I am doing this because of the good-news, in order that I might become a fellow partner of it.</p>
<p>9:24 Do you* not know that those who run in <i>the</i> stadium, all indeed run, but <i>only</i> one receives the prize? So run that* you* may grab <i>it</i>. 
9:25 But everyone who struggles <i>in the race</i> exercises self-control in all things. Therefore indeed, those <i>men do it</i> in order that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible <i>crown.</i> 
9:26 Now-then, I run as so, not with uncertainty. I am combating as so, not <i>just</i> whipping <i>the</i> air; 
9:27 but I am buffeting my body and enslaving <i>it</i>; lest <i>somehow after</i> having preached to others, I myself might become unapproved.</p>
<br>
<p>{Footnotes: 1Co 9:19, or: I was a free <i>man</i> from all<i>,</i> I was a bondservant to all.}</p>
<h3>1 Corinthians 10</h3>
<p>10:1 Now brethren, I do not wish you* to be ignorant that our fathers were all under the cloud and all went through the sea; 
10:2 and were all immersed* into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 
10:3 and all ate the same spiritual food; 
10:4 and all were drinking the same spiritual drink; for* they were drinking from a spiritual rock following <i>them</i>, and the rock was Christ. 
10:5 Yet God was not delighted in most of them; for* they were overthrown in the wilderness. 
10:6 Now these things became our examples, *that* we should not be desirers of evil things, just-as they also lusted. 
10:7 Do not become idolaters, just-as some of them were; as it has been written, ‘The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose* up to play.’ {Ex. 32:6} 
10:8 Neither should we fornicate, like some of them fornicated, and twenty three thousand fell in one day. 
10:9 Nor should we test the Christ, just-as some of them also tested <i>him</i>, and perished by the serpents. 
10:10 Nor murmur, like some of them also murmured, and perished by the destroyer. 
10:11 Now all these things <i>are</i> examples which were befalling to those <i>Jews</i>, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have arrived. 
10:12 So-then, he who thinks he stands, let him beware, lest he might fall! 
10:13 No temptation has taken you* except <i>common</i> human <i>temptations</i>, but God is faithful, who will not allow you* to be tempted beyond what you* are able to undergo, but together with the temptation, he will also make* an outlet.</p>
<br>
<p>10:14 Hence, my beloved, flee from idolatry. 
10:15 I speak as to prudent men. You*, judge what I say.</p>
<br>
<p>{Tradition, and some translations, used ‘communion’ for the word ‘fellowship’ in the verses below. The latter is the common translation of the underlying Greek word throughout the rest of the New Covenant.}</p>
<p>10:16 The cup of blessing <i>for</i> which we are giving-thanks, is it not a fellowship of the blood of Christ? The bread which we are breaking, is it not a fellowship of the body of Christ? 
10:17 Because we, who are many, are one bread, one body; for* we all are partaking from the one bread.</p>
<p>10:18 Beware <i>of</i> Israel, according to the flesh: are not those who eat the sacrifices partners of the altar? 
10:19 Then what am I saying? That an idol is anything, or that an idol-sacrifice is anything? 
10:20 But <i>I am saying</i>, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they are sacrificing to demons, and not to God, and I do not wish you* to become partners of demons.</p>
<br>
<p>10:21 You* are not able to drink <i>the</i> cup of the Lord and <i>the</i> cup of demons. You* are not able to partake of the table of the Lord and of the table of demons. 
10:22 Or are we provoking the Lord to jealousy? We are not mightier than him, are we?</p>
<br>
<p>10:23 All things are legal for me, but not all things are advantageous. All things are legal for me, but not all things build up. 
10:24 Let no one seek his own, but each <i>one seek</i> the <i>good</i> of the other. 
10:25 Eat everything which is sold in the meat-markets, judging nothing because of conscience, 
10:26 for* ‘The earth is the Lord’s and its fullness.’ {Ps 24:1} 
10:27 But if anyone of the unbelieving invites you* <i>to a feast</i> and you* wish to travel; eat whatever is placed beside you*, judging nothing because of conscience. 
10:28 But if anyone says to you*, This has been an idol-sacrifice, do not eat, because of that <i>man</i> who divulged it and <i>because of</i> conscience; for* ‘The earth is the Lord’s and its fullness.’ {Ps 24:1} 
10:29 I say, not your own conscience, but <i>the conscience</i> of the other; for* why is my freedom judged by another conscience? 
10:30 If I partake with gratitude, why am I blasphemed on behalf of what I give-thanks? 
10:31 Therefore, whether you* eat or drink, or if you* are doing anything, do all to the glory of God. 
10:32 Do not become a stumbling block, either to Jews or to Greeks, or to the congregation* of God; 
10:33 just-as I am also pleasing all <i>people</i> in all things, not seeking what is advantageous for me, but what <i>is advantageous</i> for many, that* they may be saved.</p>
<h3>1 Corinthians 11</h3>
<p>11:1 Become imitators of me, just-as I also am of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>11:2 Now I praise you* brethren that you* have remembered me in all things and are holding-onto the traditions, just-as I gave them to you*. 
11:3 But I wish you* to know, that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God. 
11:4 Every man praying or prophesying, having <i>something</i> on his head, shames his head. 
11:5 But every woman praying or prophesying with the head unveiled shames her head; for* it is one and the same thing, <i>as if</i> she had been shaved. 
11:6 For* if a woman is not veiling herself, let her <i>hair</i> also be sheared, but if it is shameful to a woman to be sheared or shaved, let her be veiled. 
11:7 For* a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, being* <i>that he is the</i> image and glory of God, but the woman is <i>the</i> glory of the man. 
11:8 For* the man is not from the woman, but the woman <i>is</i> from the man; 
11:9 for* neither was the man created because of the woman, but the woman because of the man. 
11:10 Because of this, the woman ought to have <i>a sign of</i> authority upon her head, because of the messengers. 
11:11 However, neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord. 
11:12 For* just-like the woman is from the man, so the man is also through the woman, but all things are from God. 
11:13 Judge among you* yourselves. Is it suitable that a woman pray to God unveiled? 
11:14 Or does not even nature itself teach you*, that, if a man indeed has long-hair, it is a dishonor to him? 
11:15 But if a woman has long-hair, it is a glory to her, because <i>her</i> hair has been given to her instead of a <i>head</i> dressing. 
11:16 But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the congregations* of God.</p>
<br>
<p>11:17 But <i>in</i> commanding this, I am not praising you*, because you* are not coming together *for the best but *for the worst. 
11:18 For* indeed, first <i>of all</i>, when* you* are coming together in the congregation*, I am hearing that splits exist in you*, and I believe some part <i>of it.</i> 
11:19 For* there must also be sects among you*, that* those who are approved <i>ones</i> may become apparent among you*. 
11:20 Therefore, when* you* are coming together in the same <i>mind</i>, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s supper; 
11:21 for* while* you* are eating, each <i>one</i> is taking his own supper before <i>others can</i>, and one is hungry and another is drunken. 
11:22 For* do you* not have houses *that* you* should eat and drink <i>in</i>? Or do you* despise the congregation* of God and are shaming those who have nothing? What should I say to you*? Should I praise you*? I should not praise <i>you</i>* in this.</p>
<p>{Mk 14:22-25 &amp; Mt 26:26-29 &amp; Lk 22:19-20, 1Cor: 11:23-26.}</p>
<p>11:23 For* I received from the Lord what I also gave to you*, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was being given up, took bread; 
11:24 and having given-thanks, he broke it and said, <b>Take, eat. This is my body, which is being broken on your* behalf. Practice this in my remembrance.</b> 
11:25 Likewise* also the cup, after the supper, saying, <b>This cup is the new covenant* in my blood. Practice this in my remembrance whenever you* drink <i>it</i>.</b> 
11:26 For* whenever you* eat this bread and drink this cup, you* are proclaiming the Lord’s death till whenever he comes.</p>
<p>11:27 So-then whoever eats this bread or drinks the cup of the Lord, unworthily of the Lord, will be liable to the body and of the blood of the Lord. 
11:28 But let a man test himself and so let him eat from the bread and let him drink out of the cup. 
11:29 For* he who unworthily eats and drinks, is eating and drinking judgment to himself, if he does not discern the body of the Lord.</p>
<p>11:30 Because of this, many among you* are weak and sick and a considerable <i>number</i> fall-asleep. 
11:31 For* if we were discerning ourselves, we would not be judged. 
11:32 But being judged, we are disciplined by the Lord, that* we should not be condemned together with the world. 
11:33 So-then my brethren, when* you* come together to eat, wait for one another. 
11:34 But if anyone is hungry, let him eat in <i>his own</i> house; that* you* may not come together *for judgment. Now I will appoint <i>accordingly</i> the rest as <i>to</i> whenever I come.</p>
<h3>1 Corinthians 12</h3>
<p>12:1 Now brethren, I do not wish you* to be ignorant concerning spiritual <i>gifts</i>. 
12:2 You* know that <i>when</i> you* were Gentiles, <i>you</i>* <i>were</i> led away to those voiceless idols, as you* would be led <i>now</i>. 
12:3 Hence I make known to you*, that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed, and no one is able to say, Jesus is Lord, except in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>12:4 Now there are diversities of gifts*, but the same Spirit. 
12:5 And there are diversities of services and the same Lord. 
12:6 And there are diversities of workings, but it is the same God, who is working all things in all. 
12:7 But to each <i>one</i> is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is advantageous: 
12:8 for* the word of wisdom is given to one through the Spirit, and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit; 
12:9 and to different <i>one</i>, <i>miraculous</i> faith, in the same Spirit; and to another, gifts* of healing, in the same Spirit; 
12:10 and to another, workings of miracles; and to another, prophecy; and to another, the discerning of spirits; to a different <i>one</i>, varieties of languages; and to another, the translation of <i>foreign</i> languages; 
12:11 but the one and the same Spirit is working all these things, sectioning off to each <i>one in</i> his own <i>way</i> just-as he wills.</p>
<br>
<p>12:12 For* just-as the body is one and has many members and all the members of the one body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. 
12:13 For* also, we were all immersed* into one body, in one Spirit, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondservants or free <i>men</i>, and all were made to drink into one Spirit. 
12:14 For* the body is not one member, but many. 
12:15 If the foot says, Because I am not the hand, I am not from the body; by this, is it not from the body? 
12:16 And if the ear says, Because I am not the eye, I am not from the body; by this, is it not from the body? 
12:17 If the whole body were an eye, where <i>is</i> the hearing? If the whole <i>body</i> were hearing, where <i>is</i> the sense of smell? 
12:18 But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just-as he willed. 
12:19 But <i>now</i> if they were all one member, where is the body? 
12:20 But now they are indeed many members, but one body. 
12:21 Now the eye is not able to say to the hand, I have no need of you; or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you*. 
12:22 But much rather, those members of the body that seem to be* weaker are necessary; 
12:23 and those <i>parts</i> of the body, which we think to be <i>more</i> dishonored, we place even-more honor upon these, and our indecent <i>parts</i> have even-more decency; 
12:24 but our decent <i>parts</i> have no need. But God mixed the body together, having given even-more honor to that <i>part</i> which lacks; 
12:25 that* no splits should be in the body, but <i>that*</i> the members should have the same anxiety on behalf of one another. 
12:26 And if one member is suffering, all the members are suffering together with <i>it</i>. If one member is glorified, all the members are rejoicing together with <i>it</i>. 
12:27 Now you* are the body of Christ and members individually. 
12:28 And indeed God placed some in the {F} congregation*, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, thereafter miracles, thereafter gifts* of healing, helps, those who pilot <i>others</i>, <i>those with</i> varieties of languages. 
12:29 All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not <i>workers of</i> miracles, are they? 
12:30 All do not have gifts* of healing, do they? All do not speak with <i>foreign</i> languages, do they? All do not translate, do they? 
12:31 But be zealous for the better gifts*. And I show to you* still a surpassingly-better way.</p>

<h3>1 Corinthians 13</h3>
<p>13:1 If I speak with the languages of men and of messengers, but do not have love*, I have become <i>like</i> noisy brass or a clanging cymbal. 
13:2 And if I have <i>the gift of</i> prophecy and <i>if</i> I know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so-then to remove mountains, but <i>if</i> I do not have love*, I am nothing. 
13:3 And if I handout all <i>of</i> my possessions and if I give my body that* I would be burned, but <i>if</i> I do not have love*, it profits me nothing. 
13:4 Love* has patience. It is kind. Love* is not jealous. Love* does not brag. It is not arrogant. 
13:5 It does not behave improperly. It does not seek its own. It does not irritate. It does not reason evil. 
13:6 It does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices together with the truth. 
13:7 It forbears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 
13:8 Love* never* falls short.</p>
<p>But if <i>there are</i> prophesies, they will be done-away; if <i>there are foreign</i> languages, they will cease; if <i>there is</i> knowledge, it will be done-away.</p>
<p>13:9 But we know partially and we prophesy partially; 
13:10 but whenever the completed thing comes, then <i>what is</i> partially will be done-away. 
13:11 When I was an infant, I spoke like an infant, I had the mindset like <i>that of</i> an infant, I was reasoning like an infant. Now that I have become a man, I have done-away-with the things of the infant. 
13:12 For* now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. I know now partially, but then I will fully know just-as I was also fully known.</p>
<p>13:13 But these three are remaining now: faith, hope, love*, and the greater of these is love*.</p>
<h3>1 Corinthians 14</h3>
<p>14:1 Pursue love*; yet be zealous for spiritual <i>gifts</i>, but rather that* you* may prophesy. 
14:2 For* he who speaks in a <i>foreign</i> language does not speak to men, but to God; for* no one hears <i>with understanding</i>, but he speaks mysteries in the spirit. 
14:3 But he who prophesies speaks to men <i>for</i> building up and encouragement and consolation. 
14:4 He who speaks in a <i>foreign</i> language builds himself up, but he who prophesies builds up the congregation*. 
14:5 Now I wish <i>for</i> all <i>of</i> you* to speak with <i>foreign</i> languages, but more that* you* may prophesy, for* greater is he who is prophesying than he who is speaking with <i>foreign</i> languages, unless he translates, that* the congregation* may receive building up.</p>
<p>14:6 But brethren, now if I come to you* speaking with <i>foreign</i> languages, what shall I profit you*, if I do not speak to you* either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophesying or in teaching? 
14:7 Even the lifeless things give <i>forth</i> a voice, whether flute or harp, if they do not give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? 
14:8 For* if the trumpet gives an indistinct voice, who will prepare himself *for war? 
14:9 So you* also, if you* do not give distinct speech through the <i>foreign</i> language, how shall it be known what is spoken? For* you* will be speaking into the air. 
14:10 If the varieties of <i>foreign</i> voices in the world are so-many, <i>as</i> it may be, and <i>yet</i> none are unintelligible. 
14:11 Therefore if I do not know the power of the voice, I will be a barbarian to him who speaks <i>with it,</i> and he who speaks will be a barbarian to me. 
14:12 So you* also, since you* are zealous of spiritual <i>gifts</i>, seek in order that you* may abound to the building up of the congregation*. 
14:13 Hence let him who speaks in a <i>foreign</i> language pray in order that he may translate.</p>
<p>14:14 For* if I pray in a <i>foreign</i> language, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. 
14:15 Then* what is it? I will pray with the spirit and I will also pray with the mind. I will sing-praise with the spirit and I will also sing-praise with the mind. 
14:16 Otherwise if you give-thanks with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unskilled say the amen upon your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying? 
14:17 For* you indeed give-thanks well, but the other is not built up. 
14:18 I give-thanks to my God, I speak with <i>foreign</i> languages more than you* all. 
14:19 But in the congregation*, I wish to speak five words through my mind in order that I might also instruct others, than ten thousand words in a <i>foreign</i> language.</p>
<br>
<p>14:20 Brethren, do not become children in <i>your</i> mindsets, (but be infants in malice), but become mature in <i>your</i> mindsets. 
14:21 It has been written in the law, ‘I will speak to this people in different languages and by other lips, and thus they will not even hear me, says the Lord.’ {Isa 28:11-12} 
14:22 So-then <i>foreign</i> languages are *for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving, but prophesying <i>is for a sign</i>, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe. 
14:23 Therefore, if the whole congregation* comes together in the same <i>place</i>, and <i>if</i> all speak with <i>foreign</i> languages, and <i>if</i> unskilled or unbelieving <i>people</i> come in, will they not say that you* are mad? 
14:24 But if all prophesy and some unbelieving or unskilled <i>person</i> comes in, he is reproved {Or: convicted} by all. He is judged by all. 
14:25 And thus, the secrets of his heart become apparent, and so, when* he has fallen down upon his face, he will worship God, reporting that God really is among you*.</p>
<p>14:26 Then* what is it, brethren? Whenever you* come together, each of you* has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a <i>foreign</i> language, has a translation. Let all things happen *for <i>the</i> building up. 
14:27 If anyone speaks in a <i>foreign</i> language, <i>let it be</i> according to two or three <i>at</i> the most and up individually, and let one translate. 
14:28 But if there is no translator, let him be silent in the congregation*, and let him speak to himself and to God. 
14:29 But let the prophets speak <i>by</i> two or three and let the others discern. 
14:30 But if <i>a prophesy</i> is revealed to another sitting by, let the first be silent. 
14:31 For* all of you* are able to prophesy, one by one, that* all may learn and all might be encouraged. 
14:32 The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets; 
14:33 for* God is not <i>a God</i> of unrest, but of peace.</p>
<br>
<p>As in all the congregations* of the holy-ones, 
14:34 let your* women be silent in the congregations*; for* it has not permitted for them to speak, but to be subject, as the law also says. 
14:35 And if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands in <i>their own</i> house; for* it is shameful for women to speak in a congregation*. 
14:36 What? Was it from you* that the word of God went forth? Or did it arrive only *for you*?</p>
<br>
<p>14:37 If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him fully know of the things which I write to you*, that they are the commandments from the Lord. 
14:38 But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</p>
<br>
<p>14:39 So-then my brethren, be zealous to prophesy and do not forbid <i>people</i> to speak with <i>foreign</i> languages. 
14:40 But let all things happen decently and according to <i>some</i> order.</p>
<h3>1 Corinthians 15</h3>
<br>
<p>15:1 Now I make known to you* brethren, the good-news which I proclaimed to you*, which you* also received, in which you* are also standing, 
15:2 through which you* are also saved, if you* are holding-onto the word which I proclaimed to you*– unless you* vainly believed. 
15:3 For* I gave to you*, first of all, what I also received: that Christ died on behalf of our sins according to the Scriptures; 
15:4 and that he was buried, and that he has been raised <i>up on</i> the third day according to the Scriptures.</p>
<p>{1 Cor 15:5-7, Mt 28:16-17, Mk 16:12-13, Lk 24:13-35, 24:44-49, Jn 20:26-31, Acts 1:3-8.}</p>
<p>15:5 And that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve; 
15:6 thereafter he appeared to over five hundred brethren at once, out of whom most remain until now, but some have also fallen-asleep; 
15:7 thereafter he appeared to James; thereafter to all the apostles; 
15:8 and last of all, like to the premature-baby, he appeared also to me. 
15:9 For* I am the least of the apostles, who is not sufficient to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the {F} congregation* of God. 
15:10 But I am what I am by the grace of God and his grace toward me has not become empty, but I labored even-more than they all <i>did;</i> yet not I, but the grace of God which was together with me. 
15:11 Then* whether <i>it is</i> I, or <i>it is</i> those <i>men</i>, so we preach and so you* believed.</p>
<br>
<p>15:12 Now if Christ is preached that he has been raised <i>up</i> from the dead, how do some among you* say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
15:13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has been raised <i>up</i>; 
15:14 and if Christ has not been raised <i>up</i>, consequently*, our preaching is empty, your* faith is also empty. 
15:15 Now, we are also found <i>to be</i> false witnesses of God, because we testified against God <i>in saying</i> that he raised Christ <i>up</i>; whom consequently*, he did not raised <i>up</i>, if indeed* the dead are not raised <i>up</i>. 
15:16 For* if the dead are not raised <i>up</i>, not even Christ has been raised <i>up</i>; 
15:17 and if Christ has not been raised <i>up</i>, your* faith is futile. You* are still in your* sins. 
15:18 Consequently*, also those who have fallen-asleep in Christ have perished. 
15:19 If we have hoped in Christ, only in this life, we are the most pitiful of all men.</p>
<p>15:20 But now Christ has been raised <i>up</i> from the dead, he became the first-fruit of those who have fallen-asleep. 
15:21 For* since death <i>came</i> through a man, the resurrection of the dead also <i>came</i> through a man. 
15:22 For* just-as all die in Adam, so all will also be given-life in Christ. 
15:23 But each in his own order: Christ the first-fruit; thereafter those <i>who are</i> Christ’s at his presence. 
15:24 Thereafter <i>is</i> the end, whenever he gives up the kingdom to the God and Father; whenever he does-away-with all rule and all authority and power. 
15:25 For* it is essential for him to reign, till whenever, he should place all his enemies under his feet. {Psa 110:1} 
15:26 <i>The</i> last enemy done-away-with <i>is</i> death. 
15:27 For* he has made all things subject under his feet. {Ps 8:6} But whenever he says, All things are made subject, it is evident that <i>it is all things</i> outside, who did subject all things to him. 
15:28 But whenever all things have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who did subject all things to him, that* God may be all in all.</p>
<br>
<p>15:29 Otherwise what will they do who are immersed* on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not literally raised <i>up</i>, why then are they immersed* on behalf of the dead? 
15:30 Why are we also in peril every hour? 
15:31 I die daily by your* boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
15:32 If I quarreled with beasts in Ephesus according to <i>the manner of</i> man, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised up, ‘We should eat and drink, for* the next-day we die.’ {Isa 22:13} 
15:33 Do not be misled: evil associations corrupt virtuous {F} morals. 
15:34 Be righteously sober and do not sin; for* some have ignorance of God. I say <i>this</i> to shame you*.</p>
<br>
<p>15:35 But someone will say, How are the dead raised up? And with what <i>manner of</i> body do they come? 
15:36 You fool, what you yourself sow is not given-life if it does not die; 
15:37 and what you sow, you do not sow the body that will become, but a naked kernel, it may be of wheat or anyone of the rest <i>of the grains</i>; 
15:38 but God gives it a body just-as it pleased him and to each seed a body of its own.</p>
<p>15:39 All flesh is not the same flesh, but <i>there is</i> one <i>flesh</i> of men and another flesh of animals and another flesh of birds and another of fish.</p>
<p>15:40 <i>There are</i> also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is indeed different, and the <i>glory</i> of the earthly is different. 
15:41 There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars; for* <i>one</i> star carries more-value in glory than <i>that</i> of <i>another</i> star.</p>
<p>15:42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. <i>If</i> it is sown in corruption; it is raised <i>up</i> in incorruption. 
15:43 It is sown in dishonor; it is raised <i>up</i> in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised up in power. 
15:44 It is sown a physical body; it is raised up a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body. 
15:45 So also it has been written, ‘The first man Adam became a living soul.’ {Gen. 2:7} The last Adam is giving-life *for <i>our</i> spirit. 
15:46 But the spiritual <i>was</i> not first, but the physical<i>, and</i> thereafter the spiritual. 
15:47 The first man <i>is</i> out of the earth, <i>the</i> terrestrial; the second man, the Lord, <i>is</i> out of heaven. 
15:48 Such-as <i>is</i> the terrestrial, such <i>are</i> those also who are terrestrial and such-as is the heavenly, such also <i>are</i> those who are heavenly. 
15:49 And just-as we have worn the image of the terrestrial, we should also wear the image of the heavenly. 
15:50 Now brethren, I say this, that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.</p>
<p>15:51 Behold, I tell you* a mystery, We indeed will not all fall-asleep, but we will all be changed, 
15:52 in <i>the</i> briefest moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet; for* <i>the last trumpet</i> will sound and the dead will be raised <i>up</i> incorruptible and we will be changed. 
15:53 For* it is essential this corruptible <i>body</i> to be clothed with incorruption and this mortal to be clothed with immortality. 
15:54 But whenever this corruptible <i>body</i> has been clothed with incorruption and <i>whenever</i> this mortal has been clothed with immortality, then the word that has been written will happen, Death is swallowed up in victory. {Isa 25:8} 
15:55 O death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory? 
15:56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; 
15:57 but gratitude to God, who is giving us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
15:58 So-then my beloved brethren, become grounded, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your* labor is not empty in the Lord.</p>

<p>16:1 Now concerning the collection which <i>is</i> *for the holy-ones, just-as I commanded to the congregations* of Galatia, so you* also, practice <i>such</i>. 
16:2 {F} Every first <i>day</i> of <i>the</i> week, let each of you* place beside himself, storing up, if he prospers in anything, that* whenever I come, no collections may happen then. 
16:3 Now whenever I come, I will send whomever you* approve through letters, to carry your* favor to Jerusalem; 
16:4 and if it is also worthy for me to travel <i>there</i>; they will travel together with me. 
16:5 But I will come to you*, whenever I have gone through Macedonia; for* I am going through Macedonia. 
16:6 Now when* I am <i>with you</i>; I will remain or even winter with you*, that* you* may send me onward <i>to</i> wherever I am traveling. 
16:7 For* I do not wish to see you* now on <i>the</i> way, but I am hoping to remain with you* some time, if the Lord permits. 
16:8 But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost; 
16:9 for* a large and effective door has opened to me and many <i>are</i> laying in opposition to <i>me</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>16:10 Now if Timothy comes, see <i>to it</i>, that* he may become fearless toward you*; for* he is working the work of the Lord, as I also <i>am</i>. 
16:11 Therefore let no one scorn him. But send him onward in peace, that* he may come to me; for* I am waiting for him with the brethren. 
16:12 Now concerning Apollos the brother, I encouraged him many <i>times</i> that* he should come to you* with the brethren and it was certainly not <i>his</i> will that* he should come now, but he will come whenever he has an opportunity.</p>
<br>
<p>16:13 Watch. Stand-firm in the faith. Be manly. Be powerful. 
16:14 Let all your* things happen in love*.</p>
<br>
<p>16:15 Now you* know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruit of Achaia and that they have appointed themselves to serve the holy-ones. I encourage you* brethren, 
16:16 that* you* may also be subject to those <i>who are</i> such and to everyone working together with <i>us</i> and laboring <i>with them</i>. 
16:17 Now I am rejoicing in the presence of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they fulfilled this lack of yours*, 
16:18 for* they gave-rest to my spirit and yours*. Therefore recognize those <i>who are</i> such.</p>
<br>
<p>16:19 The congregations* of Asia greet you*. Aquila and Priscilla greet you* much in the Lord, together with the congregation* <i>who is</i> in their house. 
16:20 All the brethren greet you*. Greet one another with* a holy kiss.</p>

1:6 But whether we are afflicted, <i>it is</i> on behalf of your* encouragement and salvation; which is working in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also are suffering; and our hope is steadfast on your* behalf. If whether we are encouraged, <i>it is</i> on behalf of your* encouragement and salvation, 
1:7 knowing that, just-as you* are partners of the sufferings, so you* are also of the comfort. 
1:8 For* brethren, we do not wish you* to be ignorant in regard to our affliction which happened to us in Asia, that we were burdened <i>down</i> surpassingly, beyond our power, so-that we despaired even of life. 
1:9 But, we ourselves have had the condemnation of death in ourselves, that* we should not have confidence in ourselves, but in God, who is raising <i>up</i> the dead; 
1:10 who rescued us out of so-great a death and is rescuing <i>us</i>; in whom we have hoped that he will also still rescue <i>us</i>. 
1:11 <i>You* are</i> also working together by your* supplication on our behalf; that* the gift* to us from many faces {i.e. mouths} might be a thanksgiving through many <i>people</i> on our behalf.</p>
<br>
<p>1:12 For* this is our boasting, the testimony of our conscience, that in clarity and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in <i>the</i> grace of God, we conducted ourselves in the world and even-more toward you*. 
1:13 For* we are writing no other things to you*, but what you* are reading or even <i>what</i> you* know. Now I hope you* will fully know <i>these things we write</i> until the end; 
1:14 as you* also recognized us partially, that we are your* boasting, just-as you* are also ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>1:15 And in this confidence, I was planning to come to you* beforehand, that* you* might have a second favor <i>from me</i>; 
1:16 and through you* to go through Macedonia, and from Macedonia to come to you* again and to be sent onward to Judea by you*. 
1:17 Therefore <i>while</i> planning this certain thing, I did not consequently* use fickleness, did I? Or what I plan, do I plan <i>those things</i> according to the flesh, that* there should be with me the yes, yes and the no, no? 
1:18 But as God is faithful, our word toward you* did not become yes and no. 
1:19 For* the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you* through us, <i>that is,</i> through me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but in him it has become yes. 
1:20 For* as many things as <i>are</i> the promises of God, in him <i>is</i> the yes and in him <i>is</i> the amen, for glory to God through us. 
1:21 Now he who is confirming us together with you* in Christ and anointed us is God, 
1:22 who also sealed us and gave <i>us</i> the down-payment of the Spirit in our hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>1:23 Now I myself call upon God <i>as</i> a witness upon my soul, that, <i>to be</i> sparing you*, I came to Corinth no more. 
1:24 Not that we have lordship over your* faith, but are fellow workers of your* joy; for* you* are established in the faith.</p>
<h3>2 Corinthians 2</h3>
<p>2:1 But I decided this for myself, that <i>I wished</i> not to come to you* again in sorrow. 
2:2 For* if I make you* sorrowful, who is it who also makes me joyous except he who is made sorrowful from me? 
2:3 And I wrote this same thing to you*, that*, having come <i>to you*</i>, I might not have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you* all, that my joy is <i>the joy</i> of you* all. 
2:4 For* I wrote to you* out of much affliction and dismay of heart through many tears; not that* you* should be made sorrowful, but that you* may know the love* that I have even-more toward you*.</p>
<br>
<p>2:5 But if anyone has caused-sorrow, he has not caused-sorrow to me, (that* I may not burden <i>him</i>), but partially to you* all. 
2:6 Sufficient to such a one is this penalty which was <i>inflicted</i> by the many; 
2:7 so-that you*, rather instead, <i>are</i> to forgive* him and to encourage him, lest such a one might be swallowed up with his sorrow even-more. 
2:8 Hence, I encourage you* to validate <i>your</i>* love* toward him. 
2:9 For* I even wrote *for this <i>reason;</i> that* I might know the trial of you*, if you* are obedient in all things. 
2:10 But to whom you* forgive* anything, I also <i>forgive</i>*. For* what I have also forgiven*, (<i>him</i> of whom I have forgiven* is because of you*), <i>I have forgiven</i>* in <i>the</i> face of Christ; 
2:11 that* we should not be taken-advantage of by the Adversary; for* we are not ignorant of his devices.</p>
<br>
<p>2:12 Now when* I came to Troas *for the good-news of Christ and when* a door had been opened to me in the Lord, 
2:13 I had no relief in my spirit <i>because</i> I did not find Titus my brother, but when* I had bid farewell to them, I went forth into Macedonia.</p>
<br>
<p>2:14 Now gratitude to God, who always makes us to triumph in Christ and the aroma of his knowledge in every place is manifest through us. 
2:15 Because we are a sweet-fragrance of Christ to God, in those who are saved and in those who are perishing; 
2:16 to the one an aroma from death to death, but to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is sufficient <i>in</i> these things? 
2:17 For* we are not as the rest <i>who are</i> peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, but as from God, in God’s sight, we speak in Christ.</p>
<h3>2 Corinthians 3</h3>
<p>3:1 Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? <i>As</i> if we do not need, as some, letters of commendation to you* or <i>ones</i> of commendation from you*? 
3:2 You* are our letter, having been inscribed in our hearts, known and read by all men; 
3:3 being manifested that you* are a letter of Christ, being served by us, not having been inscribed with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets <i>of</i> stone, but in tablets, in fleshly hearts. 
3:4 Now we have such confidence through Christ toward God; 
3:5 not that we are sufficient from ourselves, to reason anything as out of ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God; 
3:6 who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant*; not of the writing, but of the Spirit; for* the writing kills, but the Spirit gives-life. 
3:7 But if the service of death, by writings having been engraved in stones, happened in glory, so-that the sons of Israel were not able to stare at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, which was being done-away-with. 
3:8 How will the service of the Spirit not rather be in glory? 
3:9 For* if the service of condemnation has glory, <i>how</i> much rather is the service of righteousness abounding in glory. 
3:10 For* even what has also been glorified, has not been glorified in this respect, because of the glory which surpasses <i>it</i>. 
3:11 For* if what was being done-away <i>was</i> through glory, what remains <i>is</i> much more in glory.</p>
<p>3:12 Therefore having such a hope, we are using much boldness, 
3:13 and <i>are</i> not just-as Moses, <i>who</i> placed a veil upon his face, that the sons of Israel might not stare at the end of what was being done-away-with. 
3:14 But their minds were hardened; for* till this day, the same veil remains upon the public-reading of the old covenant*, not being unveiled, something which is being done-away in Christ. 
3:15 But to this day, when Moses is read, a veil is laying upon their heart. 
3:16 But whenever one has turned to the Lord, the veil is taken away. 
3:17 Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord <i>is</i>, there <i>is</i> freedom. 
3:18 But we all, having had our face unveiled, <i>and</i> seeing the reflection of the glory of the Lord for ourselves, are being transfigured into the same image from glory to glory, just-as from <i>the</i> Lord, <i>the</i> Spirit.</p>
<br>
<h3>2 Corinthians 4</h3>
<p>4:1 Because of this, seeing we have this service, just-as we have been shown-mercy, we are not depressed. 
4:2 But we have scoffed at the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in God’s sight. 
4:3 But even if our good-news is hidden, it is hidden among those who are perishing, 
4:4 in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, *that* the illumination of the good-news of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn for them. 
4:5 For* we are not preaching ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord and ourselves as your* bondservants because of Jesus. 
4:6 Because <i>it is</i> God, who said, ‘Illumination shine’ {Gen. 1:3} out of darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>4:7 But we have this treasure in clay vessels, that* the excellence of the power may be from God and not from ourselves. 
4:8 <i>We are</i> being pressed in every <i>way</i>, but not distressed; perplexed, but not despairing; 
4:9 being persecuted, but not forsaken; being cast down, but not being destroyed; 
4:10 always carrying around in the body the death of the Lord Jesus, that* the life of Jesus should also be manifested in our body. 
4:11 For* we who live are habitually given up to death because of Jesus, that* the life of Jesus should also be manifested in our mortal flesh. 
4:12 So-then indeed, death is working in us, but life in you*. 
4:13 But having the same spirit of the faith, according to what has been written, ‘I believed and hence I spoke.’ {Psa 116:10} We also believe and hence we also speak; 
4:14 knowing that he who raised <i>up</i> the Lord Jesus will also be raising us up through Jesus and will present us together with you*. 
4:15 For* all things <i>are</i> because of you*, in order that the grace <i>which is</i> increasing through the many, may <i>cause</i> the thanksgiving abound to the glory of God.</p>
<br>
<p>4:16 Hence we are not depressed, but even if the outward <i>man</i> is decaying, but <i>yet</i> our inward <i>man</i> is renewed day <i>in</i> and day <i>out</i>. 
4:17 For* the momentary light <i>weight</i> of our affliction, is working for us a surpassingly-better everlasting weight of glory; 
4:18 <i>because</i> we are not noting the things which are seen, but <i>note</i> the things which are not seen; for* the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are everlasting. <h3>2 Corinthians 5</h3> 
5:1 For* we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle should be torn-down, we have a building from God, a house not made* with hands, everlasting in the heavens. 
5:2 For* indeed we are groaning in this <i>house</i>, longing to be clothed with our house which is from heaven; 
5:3 if actually <i>in</i> also having clothed ourselves, we will not be found naked. 
5:4 For* indeed we who are in this tabernacle are groaning, being burdened; since we do not wish to be stripped, but to be clothed, that* the mortal may be swallowed up by life. 
5:5 Now God is the one who worked us *for this same thing, who also gave the down-payment of the Spirit to us. 
5:6 Therefore <i>we are</i> always being courageous, and knowing that when* we are at home in the body; we are away from home, away from the Lord 
5:7 (for* we are walking in faith, not through sight). 
5:8 But we are courageous and are delighted rather to be away from home, away from the body and to be at home with the Lord. 
5:9 Hence we also make it our aim to be well pleasing to him, whether at home, or away from home. 
5:10 For* it is essential <i>for</i> all of us to appear before the judicial-seat of Christ; that* each <i>one</i> may get back the things <i>done</i> in the body, for what he practiced, whether good or evil.</p>
<br>
<p>5:11 Therefore knowing the fear of the Lord, we are persuading men, but we have been manifested to God, and I hope to have also been manifested in your* consciences. 
5:12 For* we are not again commending ourselves to you*, but <i>we are</i> giving you* a starting-point of boasting on our behalf, in order that* you* may have <i>an answer for</i> those who boast in countenance and not in heart. 
5:13 For* whether we were crazy, <i>it was</i> to God; or whether we are sensible, <i>it is</i> for you*. 
5:14 For* the love* of Christ is holding us together with <i>him</i>, having judged this: that one died on behalf of all, consequently*, all died; 
5:15 and he died on behalf of all, that* those who are living should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died and rose again on behalf of them. 
5:16 So-then from hereafter we know no one according to the flesh, but even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, but now we know <i>him as such</i> no more. 
5:17 So-then if anyone is in Christ, <i>he is</i> a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. 
5:18 But all things <i>are</i> from God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ and gave the service of reconciliation to us; 
5:19 as that, God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ not counting to them their trespasses and having placed the word of reconciliation in us. 
5:20 Therefore, we are ambassadors on behalf of Christ; God <i>is</i> encouraging <i>you</i>* through us. We beseech <i>you</i>* on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. 
5:21 For* him who knew no sin, he was made* <i>the</i> sin <i>offering</i> on our behalf; that* we might become the righteousness of God in him. <h3>2 Corinthians 6</h3> 
6:1 And working together with <i>him,</i> we also encourage <i>you</i>* that you* do not accept the grace of God in vain; 
6:2 (for* he says, ‘I heard you at an acceptable time and I helped you in a day of salvation'; {Isa 49:8} behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation), 
6:3 giving no one a stumbling block in anything, that* our service might not be blamed. 
6:4 But <i>we are</i> commending ourselves in everything, as servants of God: in much endurance, in afflictions, in calamities, in distresses, 
6:5 in lashes, in prisons, in unrest, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fasts; 
6:6 in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in non-pretended love*, 
6:7 in the word of truth, in the power of God; through the weapons of righteousness, from the right and from the left, 
6:8 through glory and dishonor, through defamation and good-repute; as misleaders and <i>yet</i> true; 
6:9 as being unrecognized and <i>yet</i> being fully known; as dying and behold, we live; as being disciplined and <i>yet</i> not being slain; 
6:10 as sorrowful, yet <i>even</i> habitually rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing and <i>yet</i> having all things.</p>
<br>
<p>6:11 Our mouth has opened to you*, O Corinthians, our heart has been widened. 
6:12 You* are not distressed by us, but you* are distressed by your* own affections, 
6:13 but the same <i>as</i> recompense, (I speak <i>to you</i> as to <i>my</i> children). You* also, be widened <i>in your</i>* <i>heart</i>s.</p>
<br>
<p>6:14 Do not become unequally yoked with unbelievers; for* what partnership has righteousness and lawlessness? And what fellowship has light with darkness? 
6:15 And what agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever? 
6:16 And what alliance has a temple of God with idols? For* you* are a temple of the living God; just-as God said, ‘I will dwell among them and walk among them, and I will be their God and they will be a people to me.’ 
6:17 Hence ‘Come out from the midst of them and be separate*,’ says the Lord, ‘And touch no unclean thing, and I will accept you* 
6:18 and will be a Father to you* and you* will be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty.’ {Lev. 26:11-12; 2Sam. 7:7, 14; Isa 52:11; Jer. 32:38, 51:45; Ezek. 20:34, 41, 37:27; Amos 4:13} <h3>2 Corinthians 7</h3> 
7:1 Therefore beloved, having these promises, we should cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, completing {Or: maturing} holiness in the fear of God.</p>
<br>
<p>7:2 Make room for us: we wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we took-advantage of no one. 
7:3 I am not saying <i>this</i> toward <i>your</i>* condemnation; for* I have said before, that you* are in our hearts, *that* we may die together with <i>you*</i> and we may live together with <i>you*</i>. 
7:4 My boldness <i>of speech</i> toward you* <i>is</i> much; my boasting on your* behalf <i>is</i> much. I have been filled with <i>your</i> encouragement. I over-abound with joy in all our affliction.</p>
<br>
<p>7:5 For* even when* we came into Macedonia, our flesh <i>still</i> had no relief, but <i>we were</i> being afflicted in every <i>way</i>; outside <i>were</i> quarrels, inside <i>were</i> fears. 
7:6 But God, who encourages the humble, encouraged us at the presence of Titus; 
7:7 and not only at his presence, but also at the encouragement to which he was encouraged in you*, <i>while</i> reporting to us your* longing, your* anguish, your* zeal on my behalf; so-that I rejoiced yet more. 
7:8 Because even if I made you* sorrowful in the <i>previous</i> letter, I do not regret <i>it</i>; even if I was regretting <i>it.</i> For* I see that, that letter made you* sorrowful, even if but for a season. 
7:9 I now rejoice, not that you* were made sorrowful, but that you* were made sorrowful to repentance; for* you* were made sorrowful according to <i>the will of</i> God, in order that you* might suffer-damage in nothing from us. 
7:10 For* the sorrow <i>which is</i> according <i>to the will</i> of God is working unregrettable repentance *for salvation, but the sorrow of the world is working death. 
7:11 For* behold how much diligence this same thing, (your* being sorrowful according to <i>the will of</i> God), has worked in you*: but <i>what</i> a defense, but <i>what</i> indignation, but <i>what</i> fear, but <i>what</i> longing, but <i>what</i> zeal, but <i>what</i> vengeance! In everything you* commended yourselves to be pure in the matter. 
7:12 Consequently*, if I also wrote to you*, I <i>did</i> not <i>write</i> because of him who did wrong, nor because of him who had been wronged, but because of your* diligent-aid on our behalf might be made manifest to you* in God’s sight. 
7:13 Because of this, we have been comforted in your* comfort, we rejoiced even-more upon the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been given-rest by all of you*. 
7:14 Because if I have boasted in anything on your* behalf to him, I was not ashamed, but as we spoke all things to you* in truth, so also, our boasting which <i>was</i> to Titus became truth. 
7:15 And his affection is even-more toward you*, <i>while</i> he is remembering the obedience of you* all, how with fear and trembling you* accepted him. 
7:16 I rejoice that in everything I have courage in you*.</p>
<h3>2 Corinthians 8</h3>
<p>8:1 Now brethren, we are making known to you* the grace of God which has been given in the congregations* of Macedonia; 
8:2 because the abundance of their joy in much trial of affliction and in the depth of their poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality. 
8:3 Because according to their power, I testify, and <i>yet</i> beyond their power, <i>they gave</i> of their own accord. 
8:4 <i>They were</i> beseeching from us, with much pleading, <i>to help in</i> the favor and the fellowship of the service <i>of relief</i> to the holy-ones; 
8:5 and, not <i>only</i> as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and to us through the will of God. 
8:6 *That* we might encourage Titus, that* just-as he made a beginning before, so he might also complete this grace in you*. 
8:7 But just-as you* are abounding in everything, in faith and in word and in knowledge and in all diligence and in the love* from you* to us, <i>see</i> that* you* also may abound in this grace. 
8:8 I do not speak according to commandment, but <i>I am</i> testing the genuineness of your* love* through the diligence of others. 
8:9 For* you* know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, <i>though</i> he was rich, yet he became-poor because of you*, that* you* might be enriched through that poverty. 
8:10 And I give <i>my</i> viewpoint in this; for* this is advantageous for you*, who were the first to make a beginning from <i>the</i> past-year, not only to do <i>this</i>, but also to will <i>this.</i> 
8:11 But now also, complete the doing <i>of it</i>; *that just-as <i>there was</i> the eagerness to wish <i>it</i>, so <i>there may</i> also <i>be</i> the completing <i>of it</i> out of what you* have. 
8:12 For* if the eagerness lays before <i>you</i>*, according to whatever someone has, it is acceptable, not according to <i>what</i> he does not have. 
8:13 For* <i>I do</i> not <i>say</i> that* <i>there should be</i> relief to others but affliction to you*, but from equality, your* abundance in this current time <i>is</i> *for their lack, 
8:14 that* their abundance may also become *for your* lack, *that there may become equality, 
8:15 as it has been written, ‘He who <i>gathered</i> much had no increase, and he who <i>gathered</i> few had no less.’ {Ex. 16:18}</p>
<br>
<p>8:16 But gratitude <i>is</i> to God, who is giving the same diligent-aid into the heart of Titus on your* behalf. 
8:17 Because he indeed accepted our encouragement, but being* more diligent, he went forth to you* of his own accord. 
8:18 Now we have sent the brother together with him whose praise in the good-news <i>is known</i> through all the congregations*; 
8:19 and not only <i>this</i>, but also, having been assigned by the congregations* <i>as</i> our fellow traveling-associate together with this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself and <i>to show</i> our eagerness. 
8:20 <i>We are</i> avoiding this, lest anyone might blame us in <i>the matter of</i> this lavish donation which is served by us; 
8:21 planning-for good things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 
8:22 Now we have sent our brother together with them, whom we have proven many times diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, <i>by</i> the large confidence which <i>he has</i> in you*. 
8:23 If <i>anyone inquires</i> in regard to Titus, whether our brethren, the ambassadors* of the congregations* (the glory of Christ)– <i>he is</i> my partner and <i>my</i> fellow worker *for you*. 
8:24 Therefore show to them, the example of your* love* and of our boasting on your* behalf, in the face of the congregations*.</p>
<h3>2 Corinthians 9</h3>
<p>9:1 For* indeed, concerning the <i>relief</i> service *for the holy-ones, it is superfluous for me to write to you*: 
9:2 for* I know your* eagerness, of which I am boasting on your* behalf to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been prepared in <i>the</i> past-year, and the zeal from you* has stimulated most <i>of them.</i> 
9:3 But I have sent the brethren, that* our boasting on your* behalf may not be made void in this respect; that*, just-as I was saying, you* might be prepared; 
9:4 lest, if <i>any</i> Macedonians come together with me and might find you* unprepared, we (that* we should not say, you*) should be ashamed in this firmness of boasting. 
9:5 Therefore I deemed it necessary to encourage the brethren, that* they should go beforehand to you*, and should prearrange your* <i>previously</i> proclaimed {F} bounty. That this is to be prepared, as a {F} bounty and not as <i>something from</i> greed. 
9:6 But <i>I say</i> this<i>,</i> He who is sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who is sowing upon <i>his</i> {F} bounties will also reap upon <i>his</i> {F} bounties. 
9:7 <i>Let</i> each man <i>give</i> just-as he proposes in his heart; not out of sorrow or out of necessity {Or maybe: compulsion}; for* God loves* a joyful giver. 
9:8 Now God is able to <i>make</i> abound all grace toward you*; that* having all self-sufficiency in everything, you* should always abound to every good work; 
9:9 as it has been written, ‘He has scattered <i>them</i>, he has given to the poor; his righteousness remains forever.’{Psa 112:9} 
9:10 Now he who is supplying seed to the sower and bread *for food, may supply and may multiply your* seed and may cause the growth of the fruits of your* righteousness. 
9:11 You* are enriched in everything to all liberality, which is working through us thanksgiving to God. 
9:12 Because the service of this ministry* not only is replenishing the things lacking of the holy-ones, but is also abounding through many thanksgivings to God; 
9:13 <i>because</i> through the trial <i>of you</i>* from this service they are glorifying God upon the subjection of your* confession to the good-news of Christ and <i>at</i> the liberality of <i>your</i>* generosity toward them and toward all; 
9:14 and in their supplication on your* behalf, a longing-for you* because of the surpassing grace of God upon you*. 
9:15 But gratitude <i>is</i> to God for his indescribable gift.</p>

<p>{Footnotes: 2Co 9:5-6, elsewhere: a blessing.}</p>
<h3>2 Corinthians 10</h3>
<p>10:1 Now I, Paul, myself, encourage you* through the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who <i>when</i> face to face <i>am</i> indeed humble among you*, but being absent am courageous toward you*. 
10:2 Now I beseech <i>you</i>*, that being present*, I may not <i>need to</i> be courageous with the confidence to which I reason to be daring toward some, (those who reason <i>of</i> us as if we walked according to the flesh). 
10:3 For* <i>although</i> we are walking in the flesh, we are not warring according to the flesh. 
10:4 For* the weapons of our warfare <i>are</i> not fleshly, but <i>are</i> mighty in God, toward <i>the</i> demolition of strongholds, 
10:5 demolishing <i>evil</i> reasonings and every exalted thing <i>which is</i> lifting itself up against the knowledge of God and capturing every device <i>of the Adversary</i> to the obedience of Christ; 
10:6 and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience*, whenever your* obedience is fulfilled.</p>
<p>10:7 Are you* looking at these according to <i>their</i> countenance? If anyone has confidence in himself that he is Christ’s, let him count this again from <i>within</i>  himself, that, just-as he <i>is</i> Christ’s, so <i>are</i> we also Christ’s. 
10:8 For* even if I am boasting even-more <i>of</i> anything concerning our authority (which the Lord gave to us *for <i>your*</i> building up and not *for your* demolition), I will not be ashamed; 
10:9 that* I may not seem as if <i>I wished</i> to make you* fearful through my letters. 
10:10 Because indeed he says, The letters are weighty and strong, but the body’s presence is weak and the speech has been nothing <i>special</i>. 
10:11 Let such a one count this, that, such-as we are in word through letters, being absent, such <i>will we</i> also <i>be</i> in works, when* we are present*. 
10:12 For* we are not daring to class or compare ourselves together with some of those who are commending themselves, but they themselves, measuring themselves in themselves and comparing themselves to themselves, are without understanding. 
10:13 Now we will not boast in the immeasurable things, but according to the measure of the standard* which the God of measure divided to us <i>which is able</i> to reach even to you*. 
10:14 For* we do not overstretch ourselves, as <i>though we are</i> not reaching toward you*; {F} for* we attained even to you* in the good-news of Christ. 
10:15 <i>We were</i> not boasting in the immeasurable things, <i>(that is,</i> in another’s labors), but having hope that as your* faith grows, we will be magnified by you*, according to our standard*, *for abundance, 
10:16 <i>reaching out</i> to proclaim the good-news to what <i>lays</i> beyond you* and not to boast in the things prepared in another’s standard*. 
10:17 But he who is boasting, let him boast in the Lord. 
10:18 For* he who commends himself, that <i>man</i> is not approved <i>after being tested</i>, but whom the Lord is commending.</p>

<h3>2 Corinthians 11</h3>
<p>11:1 I wish-that you* were tolerating me in a little foolishness, but even <i>as</i> you* are tolerating <i>other things</i> from me. 
11:2 For* I am jealous <i>over</i> you* with <i>the</i> jealousy of God; for* I espoused you* to one husband, to present <i>you</i>* <i>as</i> a pure virgin to Christ. 
11:3 But I fear, lest <i>somehow</i>, as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your* minds might be corrupted from the clarity and the purity which <i>is leading</i> to Christ. 
11:4 For* if he who indeed comes, is preaching a different Jesus, whom we did not preach or <i>if</i> you* accept a different spirit, which you* did not receive or a different good-news, which you* did not accept, you* were tolerating <i>him</i> well<i>.</i> 
11:5 For* I reason to have come-short in nothing <i>compared to</i> the preeminent apostles. 
11:6 But even if <i>I am</i> unskilled in speech, but <i>nevertheless I am</i>  not in knowledge! In every <i>thing</i>, we have made <i>this</i> manifest to you* in all things. 
11:7 Or did I practice <i>some</i> sin <i>in</i> humbling myself that* you* might be exalted, because I proclaimed freely the good-news of God to you*? 
11:8 I robbed other congregations*, taking compensation <i>from them</i> for a service to you*. 
11:9 And being present* with you* and having come-short, I did not encumber anyone; for* the brethren who came from Macedonia, replenished my lack <i>of things</i> and in everything I kept and will keep myself not burdensome to you*. 
11:10 As the truth of Christ is in me, that this boasting will not be sealed up in me in the districts of Achaia. 
11:11 Why? Because I do not love* you*? God knows <i>I do</i>. 
11:12 But what I am doing, I will also <i>continue to</i> be doing <i>it</i> in order that I may cut off the starting-point from those who wish for a starting-point in order that they may be found just-as we in what they are boasting. 
11:13 For* such <i>men are</i> false apostles, workers of treachery, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ. 
11:14 And <i>it is</i> no marvelous thing; for* even the Adversary fashions himself into a messenger of light. 
11:15 Therefore, <i>it is</i> no great thing if his servants also fashion themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.</p>
<br>
<p>11:16 I say again, not anyone should think me to be foolish; otherwise, (even if as foolish), accept me that* I may also boast <i>in</i> a little something. 
11:17 What I speak in this firmness of boasting, I do not speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness. 
11:18 Since many are boasting according to the flesh, I will also boast. 
11:19 For* you*, being <i>so</i> prudent, are tolerating the foolish gladly<i>.</i> 
11:20 For* you* tolerate <i>it</i>, if anyone is enslaving <i>you*</i>, if anyone is devouring <i>you*</i>, if anyone is taking <i>from you*</i>, if anyone is lifting himself up, if anyone is whipping you* upon the face. 
11:21 I speak according to <i>our</i> dishonor, as <i>though</i> we were weak. Yet in what anyone may be daring (I speak in foolishness), I am also daring. 
11:22 Are they Hebrews? I also. Are they Israelites? I also. Are they the seed of Abraham? I also. 
11:23 Are they servants of Christ? (I speak, <i>as if</i> having insanity) I <i>am</i> beyond <i>them</i>; in labors even-more, in lashes surpassingly, in prisons even-more, in deaths often. 
11:24 Five-times, I received forty <i>lashes</i> except one by the Jews. 
11:25 I was lashed with rods three-times. I was stoned once. I was shipwrecked three-times. I have spent a night and a day in the depth <i>of the sea</i>; 
11:26 often in journeys, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from <i>my own</i> race, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils by false brethren; 
11:27 in labor and hardship, often in sleeplessness, in famine and thirst, often in fasts, in cold and nakedness. 
11:28 Plus <i>there are</i> those things which are outside, my daily pressure <i>which is my</i> anxiety for all the congregations*. 
11:29 Who is weak and I am not weak? Who is offended and I am not on fire? 
11:30 If it is essential <i>for me</i> to be boasting, I will boast <i>in</i> the things which <i>are</i> from my weakness. 
11:31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is gracious* forever, knows that I am not lying. 
11:32 In Damascus the Ethnarch of Aretas, the king, was guarding the Damascenes’ city, wishing to arrest me; 
11:33 and I was lowered through a window in a hamper <i>and</i> through the wall and fled away from his hands.</p>
<h3>2 Corinthians 12</h3>
<p>12:1 It is not advantageous for me to boast! For* I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
12:2 I know a man in Christ, <i>who</i> fourteen years before, (whether in <i>the</i> body, I do not know or outside of the body, I do not know; God knows), such a one was seized up to <i>the</i> third heaven. 
12:3 And I know such a man (whether in the body or outside of the body, I do not know; God knows), 
12:4 that he was taken away into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it is not legal for man to utter. 
12:5 I will boast on behalf of such a one, but I will not boast on my own behalf, except in my weaknesses. 
12:6 For* if I wish to boast, I will not be foolish; for* I will speak the truth, but I am refraining <i>because</i> no one should reason <i>of</i> me beyond what he sees <i>from</i> me or hears anything out of me. 
12:7 And, in order that I should not promote myself by the excellence of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of the Adversary that* it might batter me, that* I should not promote myself. 
12:8 I pleaded with the Lord three-times in regard to this thing, that* it might withdraw from me. 
12:9 And he has said to me, <b>My grace is enough for you; for* my power is completed in weakness.</b> Therefore I will rather gladly boast in my weaknesses, that* the power of Christ might reside upon me. 
12:10 Hence I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in calamities, in persecutions, in distresses, on behalf of Christ; for* whenever I am weak, then I am strong.</p>
<br>
<p>12:11 I have become a boasting fool. You* urged me <i>to it</i>. For* I ought to have been commended by you*; for* I lacked in nothing <i>over</i> those preeminent apostles, even if I am nothing. 
12:12 Indeed the signs of an apostle were worked among you* in all endurance, in signs and wonders and miracles. 
12:13 For* in what is it that you* were lesser, above the rest <i>of the</i> congregations*, except <i>in</i> that I myself did not encumber you*? Forgive* me this unrighteousness!</p>
<br>
<p>12:14 Behold, I am ready to come to you* the third-time, and I will not encumber you*; for* I am not seeking <i>what is</i> yours*, but you*; for* the children ought not to store up for the parents, but the parents for the children. 
12:15 Now I will gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your* souls; even if, <i>when</i> loving* you* even-more, <i>means</i> I am loved* even-less. 
12:16 But let it be <i>so, nevertheless,</i> I did not burden you*. But, being* crafty, I took you* with treachery. 
12:17 No, <i>not by</i> anyone whom I have sent to you*. I did not take-advantage of you* <i>in</i> anything through him, did I? 
12:18 I encouraged Titus and I sent the brother together with <i>him</i>. Did Titus take-advantage of any of you*? Did we not walk in the same spirit? <i>Did we</i> not <i>walk</i> in the same footprints?</p>
<br>
<p>12:19 Again, do you* think that we are defending ourselves to you*? We speak in Christ in God’s sight. But beloved, all things <i>are</i> on behalf of your* building up. 
12:20 For* I fear, lest, when* I come, I should find you* such-as I do not will and <i>I</i> myself might be found by you* such-as you* do not will; lest <i>there should be</i>  strifes, jealousies, furies, selfish ambitions, slanderers, malicious whisperers, arrogant-people, unrests; 
12:21 lest again when* I come my God will humble me before you* and I should mourn for many of those who have sinned before and have not repented upon the uncleanness and fornication and unbridled-lusts which they practiced.</p>
<h3>2 Corinthians 13</h3>
<p>13:1 This <i>will be the</i> third-time I am coming to you*. (Upon <i>the</i> mouth of two or three witnesses every declaration will be established.) {Deu. 19:15} 
13:2 I have told <i>you</i>* beforehand and I do say <i>again</i> like beforehand, being present* the second-time and <i>so</i>  being absent now, I am writing to <i>warn</i> those who have sinned before and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare <i>them</i>, 
13:3 since you* are seeking proof of Christ speaking in me; who is not weak toward you*, but is mighty in you*. 
13:4 For* even if he was crucified out of weakness, but <i>yet</i> he is living out of <i>the</i> power of God. For* we are also weak in him, but <i>yet</i> we will live together with him out of <i>the</i> power of God toward you*. 
13:5 Test yourselves, if you* are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you* not fully know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you*? Lest you* are unapproved! 
13:6 But I hope that you* will know that we are not unapproved. 
13:7 Now I pray to God that you* do no evil; not that* we may appear approved, but that* you* may do what is good, but <i>even if</i> we may be as unapproved. 
13:8 For* we are not able to do anything against the truth, but <i>can</i> on behalf of the truth. 
13:9 For* we rejoice, whenever we are weak, but you* may be mighty. We are also praying for this: your* completion {Or: mending}. 
13:10 Because of this, I am writing these things <i>while</i> being absent, that* I may not <i>need to</i> treat <i>you</i>* sharply being present*, according to the authority which the Lord gave me *for building up and not *for demolition.</p>
<br>
<p>13:11 Furthermore brethren: rejoice; be completed; be comforted; be mindful of the same thing; be at peace and the God of love* and peace will be with you*. 
13:12 Greet one another with* a holy kiss. 
13:13 All the holy-ones greet you*. 
13:14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love* of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, <i>be</i> with you* all.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

<h3>Galatians 1</h3>
<p>1:1 Paul, an apostle, (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him up from <i>the</i> dead), 
1:2 and all the brethren who are together with me, to the congregations* of Galatia: 
1:3 grace to you* and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1:4 who gave himself concerning our sins, *that he might liberate us out of the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father: 
1:5 to whom <i>is</i> the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>1:6 I marvel that you* are so quickly transferring yourselves from him who called you* in the grace of Christ to a different good-news; 
1:7 which is not another <i>good-news</i>, except <i>now</i> there are some who are disturbing you* and wish to pervert the good-news of Christ. 
1:8 But even if we or a messenger from heaven, should proclaim to you* any good-news contrary to what we proclaimed to you*, let him be accursed. 
1:9 As we have said before, so now I am saying again, if anyone proclaims to you* any good-news contrary to what you* received, let him be accursed. 
1:10 For* am I now persuading men or God? Or am I seeking to please men? For* if I were still pleasing men, I myself would not be a bondservant of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>1:11 For* I am making known to you*, brethren, the good-news which was proclaimed by me, that it is not according to man. 
1:12 For* I neither received it from man, nor was I taught <i>it</i>, but <i>I received it</i> through a revelation of Jesus Christ. 
1:13 For* you* have heard previously of my conduct in Judaism, how that I was surpassingly persecuting the {F} congregation* of God and was making havoc of it; 
1:14 and <i>how</i> I was progressing in Judaism beyond many <i>of my</i> contemporaries in my own race, possessing even-more zealousness for the ancestral traditions. 
1:15 But when God was delighted– he separated* me from my mother’s womb, having called me through his grace, 
1:16 to reveal his Son in me, that* I may proclaim him among the nations. Immediately, I did not consult with flesh and blood; 
1:17 nor did I go up into Jerusalem to those <i>who were</i> apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and I returned again into Damascus.</p>
<br>
<p>1:18 Thereafter, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to make the acquaintance of Peter and remained with him fifteen days. {Fall 39 AD.} 
1:19 But I did not see <i>any</i> other of the apostles, except James the Lord’s brother. 
1:20 Now concerning the things which I write to you*, behold, in God’s sight, I am not lying. 
1:21 Thereafter I came to the districts of Syria and Cilicia. 
1:22 But I was still unrecognized by face to the congregations* of Judea which <i>were</i> in Christ; 
1:23 but they were only hearing that, He who previously persecuted us is now proclaiming the good-news of the faith of which he was previously making havoc. 
1:24 And they were glorifying God with* me.</p>
<br>
<p>{Footnotes: Gal 1:13, i.e., congregated believers, Eph 4:1-6; discussed under Definitions.}</p>
<h3>Galatians 2</h3>
<p>2:1 Thereafter, I went up again to Jerusalem after fourteen years with Barnabas, also taking Titus together with me. {Acts 15} 
2:2 But I went up according to revelation, and I myself submitted to them the good-news which I am preaching among the Gentiles, (but privately before those of repute), lest I might be running or had run in vain.</p>
<p>2:3 But not even Titus who was together with me, being a Greek, was urged to be circumcised. 
2:4 But <i>it was</i> because of false brethren who were smuggled in, who entered in beside <i>us</i> to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, that* they might enslave us; 
2:5 to whom, even for an hour, we did not yield to <i>their</i> subjection; in order that the truth of the good-news might remain with you*.</p>
<p>2:6 Now they did not contribute anything to me, <i>that is from</i> those of repute <i>and</i> from those reputed to be something (what sort of <i>person</i> they were previously, carries nothing of any-value to me; God does not accept the countenance of man). 
2:7 But instead, when* they saw that I had been entrusted <i>with</i> the good-news of the uncircumcision, just-as Peter <i>that</i> of the circumcision 
2:8 (for* he who worked in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision also worked in me to the Gentiles). 
2:9 And having known the grace which was given to me, James and Cephas and John, (those reputed to be pillars), gave to Barnabas and me the right <i>hand</i> of fellowship, that* indeed we <i>should go</i> to the Gentiles but they <i>should go</i> to the circumcision, 
2:10 <i>adding</i> only that* we should remember the poor; which I was diligent also to do this same thing.</p>
<br>
<p>2:11 But when Peter came to Antioch, I stood against him to <i>his</i> face, because he had been condemned. 
2:12 For* he was eating together with the Gentiles before some came from James. But when they came, he was retreating back and separating* himself, fearing those who were from the circumcision. 
2:13 And the rest of the Jews were also hypocrites together with him; so-that even Barnabas was led away with their hypocrisy. 
2:14 But when I saw that they are not being straightforward according to the truth of the good-news, I said to Peter before <i>them</i> all, If you, being* a Jew, are living <i>like</i> a Gentile and not <i>like</i> a Jew, why do you urge the Gentiles to <i>live like</i> Jews?</p>
<p>2:15 We <i>are</i> Jews by nature and not sinners from the Gentiles; 
2:16 knowing that a man is not justified from <i>the</i> works of <i>the</i> law, if <i>it is</i> not through <i>the</i> faith of Jesus Christ also we believed in Christ Jesus, that* we might be justified from <i>our</i> faith in Christ and not from <i>the</i> works of <i>the</i> law, because no flesh will be justified from the works of the law.</p>
<p>2:17 But if seeking to be justified in Christ; if we ourselves were also found <i>to be</i> sinners, <i>is</i> then Christ a servant of sin? Let it not happen! 
2:18 For* if I build up again those things which I have torn-down, I establish myself <i>as</i> a transgressor. 
2:19 For* through the law I died to the law, that* I might live to God.</p>
<p>2:20 I have been crucified together with Christ. I am now no longer living, but Christ is living in me and that <i>life</i> which I am now living in the flesh, I am living in faith, <i>the faith</i> which <i>is</i> of the Son of God, who loved* me and gave himself up on my behalf. 
2:21 I am not nullifying the grace of God; for* if righteousness <i>is</i> through the law, consequently*, Christ died undeservedly.</p>
<h3>Galatians 3</h3>
<p>3:1 O foolish Galatians, who bewitched you* not to obey the truth, in whose eyes, Jesus Christ was portrayed among you* <i>as</i> having been crucified? 
3:2 I only wish to learn this from you*. Did you* receive the Spirit from <i>the</i> works of <i>the</i> law or from the hearing of faith? 
3:3 Are you* so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you* now being completed in the flesh? 
3:4 You* suffered vainly so-many things? If actually <i>it was</i> even vainly. 
3:5 Therefore, is the one supplying the Spirit to you*, and working miracles among you*, <i>are they</i> from the works of the law or from the hearing of faith?</p>
<p>3:6 Just-as Abraham believed God and it was counted to him *for righteousness. {Gen. 15:6?} 
3:7 Consequently*, you* know that those who <i>are</i> from faith, they are sons of Abraham. 
3:8 Now the Scripture foreseeing that God <i>would</i> justify the Gentiles from faith, proclaimed the good-news beforehand to Abraham, <i>saying,</i> ‘All the nations will be blessed in you.’ {Gen. 12:3, 18:18, 22:18, 26:4, 28:14} 
3:9 So-then those who are <i>sons</i> from faith are blessed together with the faithful Abraham. 
3:10 For* as many as are from <i>the</i> works of <i>the</i> law are under a curse; for* it has been written, ‘Cursed <i>is</i> everyone who does not remain in all things which are written in the book of the law, <i>and</i> to do them.’ {Deu. 27:26} 
3:11 Now it is evident that no one is justified in <i>the</i> law with God, because, ‘The righteous will live from faith.’{Hab. 2:4} 
3:12 Now the law is not from faith, but, ‘The man who does them will live in them.’{Lev. 18:5} 
3:13 Christ bought us up out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; for* it has been written, ‘Cursed <i>is</i> everyone who hangs upon a tree,’ {Deu. 21:23} 
3:14 that* the blessing of Abraham might happen to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus; that* we might receive the promise of the Spirit through the faith.</p>
<br>
<p>3:15 Brethren, I am speaking according to <i>the manner of</i> man, even a man’s covenant* when* it has been validated, no one nullifies or alters it with provisions. 
3:16 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He did not say and to seeds, as of many, but as of one and ‘to your seed,’ which is Christ. {Gen. 22:18, 26:4} 
3:17 Now I am saying this: the law, having happened four hundred and thirty years after<i>ward</i>, is not invalidating <i>the</i> covenant* that has been validated beforehand by God <i>in reference</i> to Christ, *that* it should do-away-with the promise. 
3:18 For* if the inheritance is out of <i>the</i> law, it is no more out of <i>the</i> promise, but God has granted it to Abraham through <i>the</i> promise. 
3:19 Then* why is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till whenever the seed has come to whom it has been promised; having been appointed through messengers by the hand of an intermediary. 
3:20 Now the intermediary is not of <i>just</i> one, but God is one. 
3:21 Then* <i>is</i> the law against the promises of God? Let it not happen! For* if a law was given which was able to give-life, righteousness really would have been from <i>the</i> law. 
3:22 But the Scriptures locked up together all things under sin, that* the promise <i>which comes</i> from <i>the</i> faith of Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</p>
<br>
<p>3:23 But before the faith came, we were being kept under the law, having been locked up together to the faith which was about to be revealed. 
3:24 So-that the law has become our tutor <i>to bring us</i> to Christ, that* we might be justified from <i>the</i> faith. 
3:25 But when* the faith came, we are no longer under a tutor. 
3:26 For* you* are all sons of God, through the faith, in Christ Jesus. 
3:27 For* as many as were immersed* into Christ were clothed with Christ. 
3:28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bondservant nor free <i>man</i>, there is no male and female; for* you* all are one in Christ Jesus. 
3:29 But if you* <i>are</i> Christ’s, you* are also Abraham’s seed and heirs according to <i>the</i> promise.</p>
<h3>Galatians 4</h3>
<p>4:1 But I am saying inasmuch time as the heir is an infant, he carries nothing <i>of</i> more-value than <i>that</i> of a bondservant, <i>though</i> he is lord of all; 
4:2 but is under guardians and stewards till the appointed-day of the father. 
4:3 So also, when we were infants, we were enslaved under the fundamental principles of the world. 
4:4 But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born out of a woman, born under the law, 
4:5 that* he might buy those up who were under the law, that* we might receive the sonship<i>.</i> 
4:6 And because you* are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. 
4:7 So-that you are no longer a bondservant, but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>4:8 But indeed <i>back</i> then, not knowing God, you* were enslaved to those who by nature are not gods. 
4:9 But now, having known God or rather having been known by God, how are you* turning back again to the weak and poor fundamental principles? Do you* again wish to be enslaved to these anew? 
4:10 You* observe days and months and seasons and years. 
4:11 I fear for you*, lest <i>somehow</i> I have vainly labored toward you*.</p>
<br>
<p>4:12 Brethren, I beseech of you*, become like I <i>am</i>, because I <i>have</i> also <i>become</i> like you* <i>are</i>. You* did not wrong me; 
4:13 but you* know that I proclaimed the good-news to you* beforehand because of a weakness of the flesh. 
4:14 And my test, which <i>was</i> in my flesh; you* did not scorn, nor spurn but you* accepted me as a messenger of God, <i>even</i> as Christ Jesus. 
4:15 Then* what <i>is</i> your good-fortune? For* I testify of you*, that, if possible, you* would have given your* eyes to me, having popped them out. 
4:16 So-then have I become your* enemy, telling the truth to you*? 
4:17 They are zealous for you* in no good way. But they wish to lock you* out <i>from us</i>, that* you* may be zealous for them. 
4:18 But it is always good to be zealous in a good thing and not only while* I am present* with you*. 
4:19 My little-children, of whom I am in travail again till whenever Christ has been formed in you*. 
4:20 But I wished to be present* with you* now, and to change my voice, because I am perplexed at you*.</p>
<br>
<p>4:21 Tell me, you* who wish to be under the law, do you* not hear the law? 
4:22 For* it has been written, that Abraham had two sons, one from the maidservant and one from the free <i>woman.</i> 
4:23 But indeed the <i>son</i> from the maidservant has been born according to the flesh, but the <i>son</i> from the free <i>woman has been born</i> through the promise. 
4:24 Which things are allegorized; for* these <i>women</i> are two covenants*; indeed one from Mount Sinai, who is Hagar, giving-birth to children into bondage. 
4:25 For* this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the Jerusalem <i>which is</i> now and she is enslaved with her children. 
4:26 But the Jerusalem <i>which is</i> above is free, which is the mother of all of us. 
4:27 For* it has been written, ‘O barren who is not bearing <i>children,</i> be joyous; burst <i>forth</i> and cry, you who is not travail, because many more are the children of the desolate rather than from her who has the husband.’ {Isa 54:1} 
4:28 Now brethren, we are children of <i>the</i> promise according to Isaac. 
4:29 But just-like then, he who was born according to the flesh was persecuting him <i>who was born</i> according to the Spirit, so it is also now. 
4:30 But what does the Scripture say? Cast out the maidservant and her son; for* the son of the maidservant may never* inherit with the son of the free <i>woman.</i> 
4:31 Consequently*, brethren, we are not children of a maidservant, but of the free <i>woman</i>.</p>
<h3>Galatians 5</h3>
<p>5:1 Therefore stand-firm in the freedom in which Christ made us free, and do not be held again in a yoke of bondage.</p>
<br>
<p>5:2 Behold, I Paul say to you*, that, if you* are circumcised, Christ will profit you* nothing. 
5:3 Now, I am testifying again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 
5:4 You* have been done-away-with, <i>cut off</i> from Christ, you* who are being justified by the law; you* have fallen from the grace <i>of God.</i> 
5:5 For* we are waiting for the hope of righteousness from faith by the Spirit. 
5:6 For* in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision prevails <i>over</i> anything, but faith working through love*. 
5:7 You* were running well; who hindered you* not to obey the truth? 
5:8 This persuasion is not from him who is calling you*. 
5:9 A little leaven leavens the whole batch. 
5:10 I have confidence in you* in the Lord, that you* will not be mindful of another <i>person</i> and he who is disturbing you* will bear his judgment, whoever he is. 
5:11 But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Consequently*, has the offense of the cross been done-away? 
5:12 I wish-that those who are unsettling you* will even castrate themselves.</p>
<p>5:13 For* brethren, you* were called to freedom; only do not <i>use</i> your* freedom *for a starting-point for the flesh, but serve* one another through love*. 
5:14 For* all <i>the</i> law is fulfilled in one word, in this: ‘You will love* your neighbor like yourself.’ {Lev. 19:18} 
5:15 But if you* are biting and devouring one another, beware, <i>that</i> you* may not be consumed by one another.</p>
<br>
<p>5:16 But I am saying, walk by the Spirit and you* may never* complete the lust of the flesh. 
5:17 For* the flesh lusts against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh, and these lay in opposition to one another; that* you* may not do the things that you* would wish. 
5:18 But if you* are led by <i>the</i> Spirit, you* are not under the law.</p>
<p>5:19 Now the works of the flesh are apparent, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, unbridled-lusts, 
5:20 idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, furies, selfish ambitions, dissensions, sects, 
5:21 envies, murders, drunkenness, revelings and things similar to these; which I am telling to you* beforehand, also just-as I did say to you* beforehand, that those who are practicing similar things– they will not inherit the kingdom of God!</p>
<p>5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love*, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, 
5:23 meekness <i>and</i> self-control. There is no law against such. 
5:24 But those who are of Christ have crucified the flesh together with the passions and its lusts.</p>
<br>
<p>5:25 If we live by <i>the</i> Spirit, we should also march by the Spirit. 
5:26 Do not become conceited, inflaming one another, envying one another.</p>
<h3>Galatians 6</h3>
<p>6:1 Brethren, even if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you* who are spiritual, mend such a one in a spirit of meekness; noting <i>any trespass</i> in yourself <i>that</i> you might not also be tempted. 
6:2 Bear the burdens of one another and thus fulfill the law of Christ. 
6:3 For* if anyone thinks <i>himself</i> to be something, being nothing, he is deceiving himself. 
6:4 But let each <i>one</i> test his own work and then he will have his boasting toward himself alone and not toward the other. 
6:5 For* each <i>one</i> will bear his own load.</p>
<br>
<p>6:6 But let him, who is instructed in the word, share with him who instructs in all good things. 
6:7 Do not be misled. God is not ridiculed; for* whatever a man sows, he will also reap. 
6:8 Because he who is sowing to his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but he who is sowing to the Spirit will reap everlasting life from the Spirit.</p>
<p>6:9 Now do not be depressed <i>while</i> doing good; for* we will reap in time, if we do not faint. 
6:10 Then* consequently*, as we have opportunity, we should work what is good toward all men and especially toward <i>those of</i> the household of the faith.</p>
<br>
<p>6:11 Behold, how-large <i>the letters of the</i> alphabet, I write to you* with my own hand. 
6:12 As many as wish to have a good* countenance in the flesh, they are urging you* to be circumcised; only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 
6:13 For* not even those who have been circumcised themselves observe the law, but they wish you* to be circumcised, that* they may boast in your* flesh. 
6:14 But let it not happen for me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world. 
6:15 For* in Christ Jesus neither anything circumcision nor uncircumcision prevails, but a new creation. 
6:16 And as many as will march by this standard*, peace <i>be</i> upon them and mercy and upon the Israel of God.</p>
<p>6:17 Furthermore let no one be harassing me, for* I bear the brands of the Lord Jesus on my body.</p>
<br>
<p>6:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with your* spirit, brethren. Amen.</p>

<h3>Ephesians 1</h3>
<p>1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, to the holy-ones who are in Ephesus and <i>the</i> faithful in Christ Jesus: 
1:2 grace to you* and peace from God our Father and <i>the</i> Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>1:3 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>is</i> gracious*, who has blessed us in every spiritual blessing in the heavenly <i>places</i> in Christ, 
1:4 just-as he chose us in him before the conception of the world, that we should be holy and unblemished in his sight in love*. 
1:5 Having predetermined us to <i>the</i> sonship through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the delight of his will, 
1:6 to the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he has favored us in the beloved, 
1:7 in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace. 
1:8 <i>The grace</i> which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, 
1:9 making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his delight which he purposed in him, 
1:10 to a stewardship of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth; in him. 
1:11 In whom, we were also made an inheritance, having been predetermined according to the purpose of him who is working all things after the counsel of his will. 
1:12 *That* we should be <i>holy</i> to the praise of his glory, we who have hoped before in Christ, 
1:13 in whom you* also, having heard the word of the truth, the good-news of your* salvation, in whom, having also believed, you* were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 
1:14 which is a down-payment of our inheritance, to the redemption of <i>God’s</i> ownership, to the praise of his glory.</p>
<br>
<p>1:15 Because of this, I, also, having heard of <i>the</i> faith in the Lord Jesus which is in you* and the love* which <i>you</i>* <i>have</i> toward all the holy-ones, 
1:16 do not cease giving-thanks on your* behalf, making* a remembrance of you* in my prayers; 
1:17 that* the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you* a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him, 
1:18 the eyes of your* heart having been enlightened, *that* you* may know what is the hope of his calling and what <i>are</i> the riches of the glory of his inheritance among the holy-ones, 
1:19 and what <i>is</i> the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of the dominion of his strength, 
1:20 which he worked in Christ, having raised him <i>up</i> from the dead and seated him by his right <i>hand</i> in the heavenly <i>places</i>, 
1:21 up above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name <i>that is</i> being named, not only in this age, but also in the future <i>age.</i> 
1:22 And he subjected all things under his feet and gave him to be head above all things to the {F} congregation*, 
1:23 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.</p>

<h3>Ephesians 2</h3>
<p>2:1 And you* were dead in trespasses and sins, 
2:2 in which you* previously walked according to the age of this world {i.e. current things of this world}, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit who now is working in the sons of disobedience; 
2:3 among whom we also all conducted ourselves previously in the lusts of our flesh, practicing the wills of the flesh and of the mind and we were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest. 
2:4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of his much love* <i>with</i> which he loved* us, 
2:5 even when* we were dead through our trespasses, he made* us alive together with the Christ; you* are saved by grace. 
2:6 And <i>God</i> raised <i>us</i> up together with <i>him</i> and seated <i>us</i> together with <i>him</i> in the heavenly <i>places</i>, in Christ Jesus; 
2:7 that* in the ages to come he might show the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 
2:8 For* you* are saved by the grace, through the faith, and this <i>is</i> not from yourselves, <i>it is</i> the gift of God; 
2:9 not from works, that* not anyone should boast. 
2:10 For* we are his product, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that* we should walk in them.</p>
<br>
<p>2:11 Hence remember, that previously you* <i>were</i> the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called* uncircumcision by what is called* circumcision, made by hands in the flesh; 
2:12 that you* were in that time separate from Christ, having been alienated from the citizenship of Israel and strangers from the covenants* of the promise, having no hope and godless in the world. 
2:13 But now in Christ Jesus you* who were previously from afar have become near <i>to him</i> in the blood of Christ. 
2:14 For* he is our peace, who made* <i>us</i> both one and tore-down the middle wall of the fence, 
2:15 having done-away-with the enmity in his flesh, <i>which is</i> the Law of commandments in decrees; that* he might create in himself from the two, one new man, <i>thus</i> making* peace; 
2:16 and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having killed the enmity in it. 
2:17 And when he came*, he proclaimed peace to you* who were from afar and <i>peace</i> to those who were near; 
2:18 because through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father. 
2:19 Then* consequently*, you* are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you* are fellow citizens of the holy-ones and <i>members</i> of the household of God, 
2:20 having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Jesus Christ himself is the cornerstone; 
2:21 in whom all <i>the</i> building, fitly framed together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; 
2:22 in whom you* are also built together into a residence of God in <i>the</i> Spirit.</p>
<h3>Ephesians 3</h3>
<p>3:1 Because of this, I, Paul, <i>am</i> the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you* Gentiles, 
3:2 if actually you* have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me *for you*; 
3:3 that he made known the mystery to me according to revelation, just-as I wrote before in few <i>words</i>, 
3:4 to which, you* are able, <i>by</i> reading <i>it</i>, to perceive my intelligence in the mystery of Christ; 
3:5 which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations, as it now was revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit. 
3:6 <i>The mystery is</i> that the Gentiles are joint heirs and a joint body and joint partakers of his promise in Christ through the good-news, 
3:7 of which I became a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power. 
3:8 This grace was given to me the least of all the holy-ones, to proclaim the untraceable riches of Christ among the Gentiles; 
3:9 and to enlighten all <i>with</i> what the stewardship of the mystery <i>is</i>, which has been hidden from the ages, in God who created all things through Jesus Christ; 
3:10 in order that now the multifaceted wisdom of God might be made known through the {F} congregation* to the principalities and the authorities in the heavenly <i>places.</i> 
3:11 <i>This was</i> according to the everlasting purpose which he made* in Christ Jesus our Lord; 
3:12 in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through the faith of him. 
3:13 Hence I ask you* not to be depressed at my afflictions on your* behalf, which are your* glory.</p>
<br>
<p>3:14 Because of this, I am bowing my knees to the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, 
3:15 from whom every family in the heavens and upon <i>the</i> earth is named, 
3:16 that* he may give you*, according to the riches of his glory, to be powerful with <i>his</i> power, through his Spirit in the inward man; 
3:17 <i>for</i> the Christ to dwell in your* hearts through the faith, 
3:18 having been rooted and having been founded in love, that* you may have strength to grab, together with all the holy-ones, of what is the width and length and depth and height, 
3:19 and to know the love* of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that* you* may be filled to all the fullness of God.</p>
<br>
<p>3:20 Now to him who is able to do, exceptionally beyond all things, what we are asking or are perceiving, according to the power which is working in us, 
3:21 to him <i>is</i> the glory in the congregation* in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<h3>Ephesians 4</h3>
<p>4:1 Therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, am encouraging you* to walk worthily of the calling in which you* were called, 
4:2 with all humility and meekness, with patience tolerating one another in love*. 
4:3 Be diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 
4:4 <i>There is</i> one body and one Spirit, just-as you* were also called in one hope of your* calling; 
4:5 one Lord, one faith, one immersion*, 
4:6 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in us all. 
4:7 Now the grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</p>
<p>4:8 Hence he says, ‘When* he ascended onto high, he captured captivity and gave presents to men.’ {Ps 68:18} 
4:9 Now this <i>saying</i>, He ascended, (what is it <i>saying</i>?) except that he also came down into the downward parts of the earth first? 
4:10 He who came down is also the same <i>as</i> he who ascended up above all the heavens, that* he might fulfill all things. 
4:11 And he gave <i>us</i> some <i>to be</i> the apostles, and the prophets, and the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers 
4:12 *for the equipping of the holy-ones, *for the work of the service, *for the building up of the body of Christ, 
4:13 till we all might achieve to the unity of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, 
4:14 in order that we may no longer be infants, bobbing on the waves and being carried about by every wind of teaching, in the trickery of men, in craftiness, with the schemes of error. 
4:15 But telling the truth in love*, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, the Christ; 
4:16 from whom all the body is fitly framed and knitted together, through every supplying joint, according to the working in measure of each part, that makes* the growth of the body to the building up of itself in love*.</p>
<br>
<p>4:17 Therefore I am saying and testifying this in the Lord: you* <i>are</i> to walk no longer as the rest <i>of the</i> Gentiles are also walking, in the futility of their mind, 
4:18 having been darkened in their mind, having been alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardening of their heart; 
4:19 who are apathetic, they gave themselves up to unbridled-lusts, *for the working of all uncleanness in greed.</p>
<p>4:20 But you* did not so learn Christ; 
4:21 if you* actually heard him and were taught by him, as <i>the</i> truth is in Jesus; 
4:22 to have placed away from yourselves the old man, according to your* former conduct, who is corrupt according to the lusts of deception; 
4:23 and to be young again in the spirit of your* mind, 
4:24 and to be clothed with the new man, who was created according to God, in righteousness and holiness of the truth.</p>
<br>
<p>4:25 Hence, placing <i>all</i> lying away from yourselves, speak each <i>one the</i> truth with his neighbor, because we are members of one another. 
4:26 ‘Be angry and do not sin.’ {Psa 4:4} Do not let the sun set upon your* anger, 
4:27 nor give a chance to the Devil. 
4:28 Let the one who steals, steal no longer, but rather let him labor, working <i>at</i> what is good with <i>his</i> hands, in order that he may have <i>something</i> to give to the one who has need. 
4:29 Let no rotten speech travel from your* mouth. But if some <i>speech is</i> good for the building up of a need, <i>do this</i>  that* it may give grace to those who are hearing. 
4:30 And do not make the Holy Spirit of God sorrowful, in whom you* were sealed to the day of redemption. 
4:31 Let all bitterness and fury and anger and outcrying and blasphemy, together with all malice, be taken away from you*; 
4:32 and become kind to one another, affectionate, forgiving* each other, just-as God also forgave* us in Christ.</p>
<h3>Ephesians 5</h3>
<p>5:1 Therefore become imitators of God, as beloved children, 
5:2 and walk in love*, just-as Christ also loved* us and gave himself up on our behalf <i>as</i> an offering and a sacrifice to God *for an aroma of a sweet-fragrance.</p>
<br>
<p>5:3 But do not let fornication and all uncleanness or greed even be named among you*, as is suitable to holy-ones; 
5:4 nor obscenity, nor foolish talk or petty jesting, which are not proper, but rather <i>the</i> giving of thanks. 
5:5 For* this you* know, that no fornicator, nor unclean <i>person</i>, nor greedy <i>person</i>, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 
5:6 Let no one deceive you* with empty words; for* because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience. 
5:7 Therefore do not become joint partakers with them. 
5:8 For* you* were previously <i>in</i> darkness, but now <i>you* are</i> light in the Lord. Walk as children of light 
5:9 (for* the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth), 
5:10 testing what is well pleasing to the Lord. 
5:11 And have no fellowship together with the unfruitful works of darkness, but also rather reprove them; 
5:12 for* it is shameful even to speak of the things happening by them covertly. 
5:13 But being reproved, all things are manifested by the light; for* everything which is manifested is light. 
5:14 Hence he says, Arise, you who are sleeping and rise* up from the dead and the Christ will appear upon you. {Isa 60:1? Maybe an early hymn?}</p>
<br>
<p>5:15 Therefore beware, how accurately you* are walking, not as unwise, but as wise; 
5:16 buying up the time, because the days are evil. 
5:17 Because of this, do not become foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord <i>is</i>. 
5:18 And do not be drunken with wine, in which there is riotousness, but be filled with* the Spirit; 
5:19 speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and singing-praise in your* heart to the Lord; 
5:20 giving-thanks always on behalf of all things in <i>the</i> name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and Father; 
5:21 subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>5:22 The wives be subject to your* own husbands, as to the Lord. 
5:23 Because the husband is the head of the wife as Christ <i>is</i> also the head of the {F} congregation*, he is <i>the</i> savior of the body. 
5:24 But just-like the congregation* is subject to the Christ, so <i>let</i> the wives also <i>be subject</i> to their own husbands in all things.</p>
<p>5:25 The husbands, love* <i>your*</i> wives, just-as the Christ also loved* the congregation* and gave himself up on her behalf; 
5:26 in order that he might sanctify her, having cleansed <i>her</i> in the bath of the water in <i>the</i> word, 
5:27 in order that he might present her, the glorious congregation*, to himself, not having stain or wrinkle or any such things, but in order that she should be holy and unblemished. 
5:28 So the husbands also ought to love* their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves* his own wife loves* himself. 
5:29 For* no one ever hated his own flesh, but is nourishing and cherishing it, just-as the Lord also <i>does</i> the {F} congregation*; 
5:30 because we are members of his body, out of his flesh and out of his bones. 
5:31 Because of this, a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to <i>his</i> wife, and the two will become one flesh. 
5:32 This mystery is great, but I am speaking <i>in regard</i> to Christ and <i>in regard</i> to the {F} congregation*. 
5:33 However <i>to</i> you* also, let each one accordingly love* his own wife like himself, and <i>let</i> the wife <i>see</i> that* she should fear her husband.</p>

<h3>Ephesians 6</h3>
<p>6:1 The children, obey* your* parents in <i>the</i> Lord; for* this is righteous. 
6:2 Honor your father and mother (which is the first commandment in <i>the</i> promise), 
6:3 that* it may become well with you, and you may be upon the earth a long time. 
6:4 And the fathers, do not rouse your* children to anger, but rear them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>6:5 The bondservants, be obedient* to <i>your*</i> lords according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in clarity of your* heart, as to the Christ; 
6:6 not according to eye-service, like men-pleasers, but like bondservants of the Christ, practicing the will of God from <i>your*</i> soul; 
6:7 serving* with benevolence to the Lord and not to men. 
6:8 Knowing that if each <i>one</i> has done anything good, he will get this back from the Lord, whether bondservant or free <i>man</i>. 
6:9 And the lords, do the same things toward them and be lax <i>with the</i> threatening; knowing that your* own Lord is also in the heavens and there is no partiality with him.</p>
<br>
<p>6:10 Furthermore, my brethren, be empowered in the Lord and in the dominion of his strength. 
6:11 Clothe yourselves with the full-armor of God, *that* you* may be able to stand <i>up</i> before the schemes of the Devil. 
6:12 Because the wrestling in us is not pertaining to flesh and blood, but pertaining to the principalities, pertaining to the authorities, pertaining to the world dominions of the darkness of the world, pertaining to the spiritual <i>armies</i> of wickedness in the heavenly <i>places.</i> 
6:13 Because of this, take up the full-armor of God, that* you* may be able to stand against <i>darkness</i> in the evil day, and to stand <i>straight</i>, having worked against all things. 
6:14 Therefore stand, having girded your* loins in truth and having clothed yourselves with the breastplate of righteousness, 
6:15 and having tied <i>each of</i> your feet with* the readiness of the good-news of peace. 
6:16 Upon all <i>these</i> things, when* you have taken up the shield of the faith, in which you* will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil <i>one;</i> 
6:17 also <i>able</i> to accept the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, 
6:18 through all prayer and supplication praying in all seasons in the Spirit and to this same thing, watching in all perseverance and supplication concerning all the holy-ones. 
6:19 And <i>pray</i> on my behalf, that* <i>the</i> word may be given to me, in opening my mouth to make known the mystery of the good-news in boldness, 
6:20 on behalf of which, I am an ambassador in a chain; that* I should speak boldly in it, as it is essential <i>for</i> me to speak.</p>
<br>
<p>6:21 But that* you* may also know the things in <i>regard to</i> me, what I am doing; I will make known to you* all things. Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, 
6:22 whom I sent to you* *for this same thing, that* you* may know the things concerning us, and <i>that*</i> he may encourage your* hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>6:23 Peace and love* be to the brethren with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<h3>Philippians 1</h3>
<p>1:1 Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ, to all the holy-ones in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, together with <i>the</i> overseers and deacons {1Tim 3}: 
1:2 grace to you* and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>1:3 I am giving-thanks to my God upon every remembrance of you*, 
1:4 always in every supplication of mine on behalf of all of you*, making* my supplication with joy, 
1:5 for your* fellowship in the good-news from the first day till now. 
1:6 I have confidence of this same thing, that he who has begun a good work in you* will complete it till the day of Jesus Christ; 
1:7 just-as it is a righteous thing for me to be mindful of this on behalf of all of you*, because I had you* in my heart, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the good-news, all of you* being joint partners with me of the grace. 
1:8 For* God is my witness, how I am longing-for all of you* in the affections of Christ Jesus. 
1:9 And I am praying for this: that* your* love* may abound still more and more in full knowledge and all comprehension; 
1:10 *that* you* may approve the things that are carrying more-value; that* you* may be sincere and guilt-free in the day of Christ; 
1:11 having been filled from the fruits of righteousness, which <i>come</i> through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</p>
<br>
<p>1:12 Now brethren, I am planning for you* to know, that the things against me have come rather *for the progress of the good-news; 
1:13 so-that my bonds became apparent in Christ in the whole palace guard and to all the rest; 
1:14 and that most of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence because of my bonds, are even-more daring to speak fearlessly the word <i>of God</i>. 
1:15 Some indeed are preaching Christ even because of envy and strife, but some also through <i>their</i> delight. 
1:16 Those are indeed proclaiming Christ out of selfish ambition, not purely, assuming to bring affliction to my bonds. 
1:17 But the <i>latter</i> ones <i>do it</i> out of love*, knowing that I am destined *for the defense of the good-news. 
1:18 For* what <i>then</i>? Except* <i>that</i> in every manner, whether in pretext or whether in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and I am rejoicing in this, but also, I will rejoice <i>again</i>. 
1:19 For* I know that this will transpire *for my salvation, through your* supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
1:20 according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will be shamed in nothing, but <i>that</i> in all boldness, as always, <i>so</i> now Christ will also be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death. 
1:21 For* to me to live <i>is</i> Christ, and to die <i>is</i> gain. 
1:22 But if to live in the flesh– <i>if</i> this will bring fruit from my work, and what will I select for myself? I do not know. 
1:23 But I am troubled from the two <i>ends</i>, having the desire, *that* I should vacate and be together with Christ<i>, but it is</i> much, much better 
1:24 now to remain in the flesh, <i>and is</i> more necessary because of you*. 
1:25 And having confidence <i>of</i> this, I know that I will remain, and I will abide together with you* all, *for your* progress and joy in the faith; 
1:26 that* your* boasting may abound in Christ Jesus, <i>and</i> in me, through my presence with you* again. 
1:27 Only behave-as citizens worthy of the good-news of Christ; that*, whether I come and see you*, or am absent, I may hear <i>about</i> the things concerning you*, that you* are standing-firm in one spirit, with one soul contending together with <i>us</i> in the faith of the good-news. 
1:28 And being terrified in nothing by those who lay in opposition to <i>you*</i>; which to them indeed is an example of destruction, but to you* <i>is an example</i> of salvation and this <i>is</i> from God, 
1:29 because it was granted to you* on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf; 
1:30 having the same struggle which you* saw in me, and now are hearing to be in me.</p>
<h3>Philippians 2</h3>
<p>2:1 Therefore, if <i>there is</i> any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love*, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affections and mercies, 
2:2 fulfill my joy, <i>which is</i> that* you* may be mindful of the same thing, having the same love*, fellowship in spirit*, being mindful of the one thing 
2:3 (nothing according to selfish ambition or through empty conceit, but in humility): deeming one another superior to yourselves; 
2:4 each <i>of you*</i>, do not note the things of yourselves, but also each <i>of you*, note</i> the things of others. 
2:5 For* let this mindset be in you*, which <i>was</i> also in Christ Jesus: 
2:6 who, existing in <i>the</i> form of God, did not deem <i>it</i> a seizure to be equal with God, 
2:7 but emptied himself, having taken the form of a bondservant, having become in the likeness of men; 
2:8 and having been found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, having become obedient as far as death, even the death of the cross. 
2:9 Hence, God also highly exalted him, and granted to him the name which is above every name; 
2:10 that* every knee should bow in the name of Jesus, <i>all</i> in heavenly <i>places</i> and <i>in</i> earthly and <i>in the</i> subterranean, 
2:11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
<br>
<p>2:12 So-then my beloved, just-as you* have always obeyed*, not only as in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your* own salvation with fear and trembling. 
2:13 For* it is God who is working in you* both to will and to work, on behalf of his delight. 
2:14 Do all things without murmurings and questionings, 
2:15 in order that you* might become blameless and harmless children of God, flawless in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you*appear as illuminations in the world. 
2:16 <i>Keep</i> holding onto the word of life, *for a boast to me in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain. 
2:17 But even if I am a drink-offering upon the sacrifice and ministry* of your* faith, I am rejoicing, and <i>even</i> rejoicing together with all of you*. 
2:18 Now you* also, rejoice in the same thing, and rejoice together with me.</p>
<br>
<p>2:19 Now I am hoping in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you* shortly, that* I may also be in good* spirits* when* I know <i>about</i> the things concerning you*. 
2:20 For* I have no one equal in spirit*, who will be genuinely anxious <i>about</i> the things concerning you*. 
2:21 For* they are all seeking their own, not the things of Jesus Christ. 
2:22 But you* know the trial of him, that as a child <i>serves</i> a father, <i>so</i> he served* together with me *for the good-news. 
2:23 Therefore, I am indeed hoping to send him promptly, as I may look away from things concerning me, 
2:24 but I have confidence in the Lord that I myself will also come shortly.</p>
<p>2:25 But I deemed it necessary to send to you* Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your* ambassador* and minister* to my need; 
2:26 since he was longing-for you* all, and was disheartened because you* had heard that he was sick. 
2:27 For* indeed he was sick– close to death. But God showed-mercy on him, now not him only, but also me, that* I might not have sorrow upon sorrow. 
2:28 Therefore, I have sent him more diligently, that* when* you* see him again, you* should rejoice and <i>that*</i> I may be sorrow-free. 
2:29 Therefore accept him in the Lord with all joy, and hold those who are such <i>as</i> admired; 
2:30 because he drew near <i>almost</i> as far as death, because of the work of the Christ, disregarding his life in order that* he might fill the lack in your* ministry* toward me.</p>
<h3>Philippians 3</h3>
<p>3:1 Furthermore, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. Indeed, it is not tedious for me to write the same things to you*, but <i>for</i> your* certainty. 
3:2 Beware of the dogs; beware of the evil workers; beware of the mutilation. 
3:3 For* we are the circumcision<i>,</i> who are giving-divine service in the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh; 
3:4 although I myself might have confidence in the flesh; if some other is thinking to have confidence in the flesh, I yet <i>even</i> more. 
3:5 <i>I was</i> circumcised <i>on</i> the eighth day, from the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew out of Hebrews; according to the law, a Pharisee; 
3:6 according to zeal, <i>I was</i> persecuting the {F} congregation*; according to the righteousness which is in the law, I became blameless. 
3:7 But what things were gains to me, I have deemed these a forfeiture because of Christ. 
3:8 But therefore, I am also deeming all things indeed to be a forfeiture because of the superiority of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, because of whom, I forfeited all things, and am deeming <i>them</i> to be <i>but</i> trash, that* I may gain Christ, 
3:9 and may be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, which is from the law, but which <i>is</i> through <i>the</i> faith of Christ, the righteousness <i>which is</i> from God on the faith, 
3:10 that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being transformed to his death; 
3:11 if somehow I may achieve to the resurrection from the dead. 
3:12 Not that I have already received <i>it</i> or have already been completed <i>in this</i>, but I am pursuing <i>it</i>, if I might grab that for which I was also grabbed by Christ Jesus. 
3:13 Brethren, I do not reason to have grabbed <i>it</i>, but one thing <i>I</i> indeed <i>do</i>, forgetting the things which are behind <i>me</i> and stretching forth to the things which are before <i>me</i>. 
3:14 I am pursuing toward the goal for the prize of the upward calling of God in Christ Jesus. 
3:15 Therefore, as many as <i>are</i> mature, we should be mindful of this, and if you* are mindful of anyone differently, God will also reveal this to you*; 
3:16 however in what we have attained, <i>we are</i> to march by the same standard*, to be mindful of the same things.</p>
<br>
<p>3:17 Brethren, become joint imitators of me, and note those who are walking so, just-as you* have us <i>as</i> an example. 
3:18 For* many are walking, (of whom I was speaking to you* often <i>about them</i>; now I am also telling <i>you*</i>, weeping), <i>who are</i> the enemies of the cross of Christ: 
3:19 whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly and <i>whose</i> glory is in their shame, who are mindful of earthly things. 
3:20 For* our citizenship exists in the heavens; out of which we are also waiting for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. 
3:21 He will fashion the body of our humbleness, *that* it may become transformed to the body of his glory, according to the working of which he is able to even subject all things to himself.</p>

<h3>Philippians 4</h3>
<p>4:1 So-then my brethren, beloved and longed-for, my joy and crown, so stand-firm in the Lord, my beloved.</p>
<br>
<p>4:2 I am encouraging Euodia, and I am encouraging Syntyche, <i>both</i> to be mindful of the same thing in the Lord. 
4:3 Yes, I am also requesting you, genuine colleague, help these <i>women</i>, who contended together with me in the good-news, also with Clement, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.</p>
<br>
<p>4:4 Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, Rejoice. 
4:5 Let your* gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is near. 
4:6 Be anxious in nothing, but in everything, let your* requests be made known to God by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving. 
4:7 And the peace of God, which is superior to all perception, will guard your* hearts and your* minds in Christ Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>4:8 Furthermore brethren, as many things as are true, as many as <i>are</i> honorable, as many as <i>are</i> righteous, as many as <i>are</i> pure, as many as <i>are</i> lovely, as many as <i>have</i> good-repute; if there is any virtue and if there is any praise, reason <i>on</i> these things. 
4:9 The things which you* both learned and received and heard and saw in me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you*.</p>
<br>
<p>4:10 But I rejoice in <i>the</i> Lord greatly, that now at last, you* have bloomed again <i>the desire</i> to be mindful of <i>things</i> on my behalf; on this, you* were even mindful of <i>me</i>, but you* had no opportunity. 
4:11 Not that I am speaking according to <i>my</i> lack <i>of things</i>; for* I have learned to be content in whatever <i>state</i> I am <i>in.</i> 
4:12 I know <i>how</i> to be humbled and I also know <i>how</i> to abound. I have been initiated in everything, and in all things, both to be fed and to be hungry, both to abound and to lack. 
4:13 I am strong in all things in Christ, who is empowering me.</p>
<br>
<p>4:14 However you* did well, having shared together with my affliction. 
4:15 Now you* also know, you* Philippians, that in the beginning of the good-news, when I went out from Macedonia, no congregation* shared with me in the matter {Greek: word. Or: The Word} of the giving and receiving, except you* only. 
4:16 Because even in Thessalonica, you* sent once and <i>then</i> twice to my need. 
4:17 Not that I am seeking after a present, but I am seeking after the fruit that increases to your* account. 
4:18 But I have all things, and I am abounding. I have been filled, having accepted from Epaphroditus the things <i>that came</i> from you*, an aroma of a sweet-fragrance, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God. 
4:19 Now my God will fill every need of yours* according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 
4:20 Now to our God and Father <i>be</i> the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>4:21 Greet every holy-one in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are together with me greet you*. 
4:22 All the holy-ones greet you*, especially those who are from Caesar’s household.</p>
<br>
<p>4:23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with all of you*. Amen.</p>

<h3>Colossians 1</h3>
<p>1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, 
1:2 to the holy and faithful brethren in Christ <i>who are</i> in Colosse: grace to you* and peace from God our Father and <i>the</i> Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>1:3 We are giving-thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always praying concerning you*, 
1:4 having heard of your* faith in Christ Jesus and of the love* which <i>you</i>* <i>have</i> toward all the holy-ones, 
1:5 because of the hope which <i>is</i> laid up for you* in the heavens, of which you* heard beforehand in the word of the truth of the good-news. 
1:6 <i>This good-news</i> which is present* *for you*; just-as <i>it</i> also <i>is</i> in all the world and is bearing-fruit, just-as <i>it</i> also <i>does</i> in you*, since the day you* heard and fully knew the grace of God in truth; 
1:7 just-as you* also learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow bondservant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on your* behalf, 
1:8 who also indicated to us your* love* in the Spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>1:9 Because of this, we also, from the day we heard <i>it</i>, do not cease praying and asking on your* behalf, that* you* may be filled with the full knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and intelligence, 
1:10 <i>for</i> you* to walk worthy of the Lord for* pleasing <i>him</i> in everything, bearing-fruit in every good work and growing into the full knowledge of God; 
1:11 empowered in all power, according to the dominion of his glory, *for all endurance and patience with joy 
1:12 giving-thanks to the Father. He who made us sufficient *for the part of the inheritance of the holy-ones in light. 
1:13 He rescued us out of the authority of darkness and transplanted us into the kingdom of the Son of his love*; 
1:14 in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins, 
1:15 who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; 
1:16 because all things were created by him, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth, the visible and invisible. Whether thrones or lordships or principalities or authorities, all things have been created through him and *for him. 
1:17 And he is before all things and all things are standing {Or: established} in him. 
1:18 And he is the head of the body, the {F} congregation*; who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that* he might become foremost in all things. 
1:19 Because all the fullness was delighted to dwell in him; 
1:20 and through him to reconcile all things to himself, whether things upon the earth or things upon the heavens, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him. 
1:21 And you* were previously alienated and <i>were</i> enemies in your* mind <i>and</i> in your* evil works, yet now he has reconciled <i>you</i>* 
1:22 in the body of his flesh through death, to present you* holy and unblemished and irreproachable in his sight; 
1:23 if actually you* are abiding in the faith, having been founded and grounded and not being moved away from the hope of the good-news which you* heard, which was preached in all creation which <i>is</i> under heaven; of which I, Paul, became a servant.</p>
<br>
<p>1:24 Now I am rejoicing in my sufferings on your* behalf and I am filling up in my flesh, the things lacking of the afflictions of Christ on behalf of his body, which is the {F} congregation*; 
1:25 of which I became a servant, according to the stewardship of God which was given to me *for you*, to fulfill the word of God, 
1:26 the mystery that has been hid from the ages and generations, but now it has been manifested to his holy-ones. 
1:27 To whom God willed to make known among the Gentiles what <i>are</i> the riches of the glory of this mystery, who is Christ in you*, the hope of glory. 
1:28 <i>The Christ</i> whom we are proclaiming, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that* we should present every man complete in Christ Jesus; 
1:29 *for which I also labor, struggling according to his working, which works in power in me.</p>
<br>

<h3>Colossians 2</h3>
<p>2:1 For* I wish you* to know how-vast a struggle I have concerning you* and those in Laodicea and as many as have not seen my face in <i>the</i> flesh; 
2:2 in order that their hearts might be encouraged, having been knitted together in love* and in all <i>the</i> riches of the full assurance of understanding, to <i>the</i> full knowledge of the mystery of God and Father and of Christ, 
2:3 in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.</p>
<br>
<p>2:4 But I am saying <i>all of</i> this, in order that not anyone may delude you* in persuasive speech. 
2:5 For* even if I am absent in the flesh, but <i>yet</i> I am together with you* in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your* order and the firmness of your* faith in Christ.</p>
<p>2:6 Therefore, as you* received Christ Jesus the Lord, <i>so</i> walk in him, 
2:7 having been rooted and being built up in him and steadfast in the faith, just-as you* were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.</p>
<br>
<p>2:8 Beware, <i>that</i> there will not be anyone who is leading you* away as <i>his</i> prey through philosophy and vain deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the fundamental principles of the world, and not according to Christ, 
2:9 because all the fullness of the Deity is dwelling in him bodily. 
2:10 And you* are fulfilled in him, who is the head of all principality and authority; 
2:11 in whom you* were also circumcised with a circumcision not made* with hands, in the stripping off of the body of the sins of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ, 
2:12 having been buried together with him in the immersion*, in which you* were also raised <i>up</i> together with him through the faith in the working of God, who raised him up from the dead. 
2:13 And you*, being dead in your* trespasses and the uncircumcision of your* flesh, he made* <i>you*</i> alive together with him, having forgiven* us all our trespasses; 
2:14 having wiped-away the handwriting in the decrees <i>that were</i> against us, which were adverse to us. He has also taken it out of the midst <i>of us</i>, having nailed it to the cross; 
2:15 having stripped off the principalities and the authorities, he publicly made a show of them, triumphing over them in it.</p>
<br>
<p>2:16 Therefore do not let anyone judge you* in food, or in drink, or in the respect of a feast day, or a new month, or a Sabbath day; 
2:17 which are a shadow of the future things, but the body is Christ’s. 
2:18 Let no one arbitrate against you*, willing <i>it so</i> in <i>your</i>* humility and <i>in</i> a religion of the messengers; stepping <i>you* further</i> into the things which he has not seen, vainly arrogant by his fleshly mind, 
2:19 and not holding-fast <i>to</i> the head, from whom all the body <i>is</i> being supplied and knitted together through the joints and ligaments, which is growing <i>with</i> the growth of God.</p>
<br>
<p>2:20 If you* died together with Christ from the fundamental principles of the world, why, (as <i>though</i> living in the world), are you* submissive to its decrees: 
2:21 <i>such as</i>, do not touch; do not taste; do not handle; 
2:22 (which things in the using are all <i>leading</i> to corruption), according to the commandments and teachings of men? 
2:23 Which indeed in man-made religion have a reason <i>which comes</i> from <i>man’s</i> wisdom and humility and unsparing cruelty of the body<i>, but are</i> not of any value toward the indulgence of the flesh.</p>
<h3>Colossians 3</h3>
<p>3:1 Therefore, if you* were raised <i>up</i> together with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is, seated at the right <i>hand</i> of God. 
3:2 Be mindful of the things which are above, not the things which are upon the earth. 
3:3 For* you* died and your* life has been hid together with Christ in God. 
3:4 Whenever Christ, <i>who is</i> our life, is manifested, then you* will also be manifested together with him in glory.</p>
<br>
<p>3:5 Therefore mortify your* members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire and greed, which is idolatry. 
3:6 Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience; 
3:7 among whom you* also previously walked, when you* were living in these things. 
3:8 But also now, place all these things away from yourselves: anger, fury, malice, blasphemy, obscene speech from your* mouth.</p>
<p>3:9 Do not lie to one another; since you* have stripped off the old man together with his practices, 
3:10 and have clothed yourselves with the new <i>man</i>, who is being renewed to <i>the</i> full knowledge according to the image of him who created him; 
3:11 where there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, <i>or</i> free <i>man</i>, but Christ is all things and in all.</p>
<br>
<p>3:12 Therefore as God’s chosen, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with a heart* of mercy, kindness, humility, meekness, patience, 
3:13 tolerating one another and forgiving* each other. If anyone has a complaint toward anyone; just-as the Christ forgave* you*, so you* also <i>forgive</i>*. 
3:14 But over all these things <i>be clothed with</i> love*, which is the bond of maturity. 
3:15 And let the peace of God be arbitrating in your* hearts, to which you* were also called in one body, and become thankful. 
3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you* richly, in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing each other in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing in gratitude in your* heart to the Lord. 
3:17 And everything, anything, whatever you* do in word or in work, <i>do</i> all things in <i>the</i> name of the Lord Jesus, giving-thanks to the God and Father through him.</p>
<br>
<p>3:18 The wives, be subject to your* own husbands, as is proper in the Lord.</p>
<p>3:19 The husbands, love* your* wives, and do not be bitter toward them.</p>
<p>3:20 The children, obey* your* parents according to all things, for* this is well pleasing in <i>the</i> Lord.</p>
<p>3:21 The fathers, do not aggravate your* children, in order that they may not be discouraged.</p>
<p>3:22 The bondservants be obedient according to all things, those who are your* lords according to the flesh; not in your* eye-services, like men-pleasers, but in clarity of heart, fearing God.</p>
<p>3:23 And everything, anything whatever you* do, work from <i>your</i> soul, as <i>you would</i> to the Lord and not <i>as</i> to men; 
3:24 knowing that you* will receive from <i>the</i> Lord the payment of the inheritance; for* you* are serving* the Lord Christ. 
3:25 But he who does wrong will get back what he did wrong and there is no partiality <i>with God</i>. <h3>Colossians 4</h3> 
4:1 The lords, provide what <i>is</i> just and what <i>is</i> equal to your* bondservants; knowing that you* also have a Lord in <i>the</i> heavens.</p>
<br>
<p>4:2 Persevere in <i>your*</i> prayer, watching in it, in <i>the</i> giving of thanks; 
4:3 praying at the same time concerning us also, that* God may open a door of the word to us, to speak the mystery of the Christ, because of which I have also been bound; 
4:4 that* I may manifest it, as it is essential <i>for</i> me to speak. 
4:5 Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, buying up the time. 
4:6 <i>Let</i> your* speech always <i>be</i> in grace, having been seasoned in salt, that you* may know how it is essential <i>for</i> you* to answer each one.</p>
<br>
<p>4:7 Tychicus will make all my things known to you*, the beloved brother and faithful servant, and <i>my</i> fellow bondservant in <i>the</i> Lord; 
4:8 whom I have sent to you* *for this same thing, that* he might know <i>about</i> the things concerning you* and <i>that*</i> he may comfort your* hearts; 
4:9 together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one out of you*. They will make known to you* all things which <i>are done</i> here.</p>
<br>
<p>4:10 Aristarchus my fellow captive greets you*, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you* received commandments; if he comes to you*, accept him), 
4:11 and Jesus who is called* Justus, who is out of the circumcision. These <i>are my</i> only fellow workers *for the kingdom of God, those who became a comfort to me. 
4:12 Epaphras, a bondservant of Christ, who <i>is</i> one out of you*, greets you*. <i>He is</i> always fighting on your* behalf in <i>his</i> prayers, that* you* might stand complete and fulfilled in all the will of God. 
4:13 For* I am testifying of him, that he has much zeal on your* behalf, and those in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis. 
4:14 Luke, the beloved physician and Demas greet you*. 
4:15 Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the congregation* which is in his house.</p>
<p>4:16 And whenever this letter has been read by you*, do <i>forward it</i>, that* it should also be read in the congregation* of the Laodiceans, and that* you* also should read the letter from Laodicea. 
4:17 And say to Archippus, Beware <i>that</i> the service which you have received in the Lord, that* you should fulfill it.</p>
<br>
<p>4:18 The greeting from me, Paul, with my own hand. Remember my bonds. Grace <i>be</i> with you*. Amen.</p>

<h3>1 Thessalonians 1</h3>
<p>1:1 Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the congregation* of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: grace to you* and peace from God our Father and <i>the</i> Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>1:2 We are always giving-thanks to God concerning you* all, making* a remembrance of you* in our prayers; 
1:3 constantly remembering your* work of the faith, and labor of love*, and endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father, 
1:4 knowing your* choice brethren, <i>who are</i> beloved by God. 
1:5 <i>You</i>* <i>know</i> because our good-news did not only come* to you* in word, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much full assurance; just-as you* know what <i>manner of men</i> we became among you*, because of you*. 
1:6 And you* became imitators of us and of the Lord, having accepted the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit; 
1:7 so-that you* became examples to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia. 
1:8 For* the word of the Lord has echoed forth from you*, not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but also in every place your* faith toward God has gone forth; so-that we do not need to say anything. 
1:9 For* they themselves are reporting concerning us, what sort of entrance we had toward you*, and how you* turned from idols to God, to serve* a living and true God, 
1:10 and to await his Son Jesus, from the heavens, whom he raised <i>up</i> from the dead; who rescues us from the wrath to come.</p>
<h3>1 Thessalonians 2</h3>
<p>2:1 For* brethren, you* yourselves know our entrance to you*, that it has not become empty. 
2:2 But having suffered before, and having been abused in Philippi {Acts 16:12-40}, as you* know, we were bold in our God to speak to you* the good-news of God, <i>even</i> in <i>our</i> large struggle.</p>
<p>2:3 For* our encouragement <i>is</i> not from deceit, nor from uncleanness, nor in treachery. 
2:4 But just-as we have been approved by God to be entrusted <i>with</i> the good-news, so we are speaking; not as pleasing men, but God who tests our hearts. 
2:5 For* as you* know, we neither previously came* in words of flattery, nor in a pretext of greed, (God is <i>our</i> witness); 
2:6 nor <i>were we</i> seeking glory from men, neither from you* nor from others, <i>even though</i> we were able to be a burden <i>to you</i>* as apostles of Christ. 
2:7 But we became mild in your* midst, as a nurse may cherish her own children. 
2:8 So having kindly-feelings of you*, we were delighted to have given to you* not only the good-news of God, but also our own souls, because you* have become beloved to us.</p>
<p>2:9 For* brethren, you* remember our labor and hardship. For* <i>we were</i> working night and day, *that* we might not burden any of you* <i>while</i> we preached to you* the good-news of God. 
2:10 You* and God are witnesses, as <i>in this</i> we became holy and righteous and blameless toward you* who believe. 
2:11 Just-as you* know, as <i>in this</i> we <i>became with</i> each one of you*, like a father <i>with</i> his own children, encouraging you* and consoling <i>you</i>* 
2:12 and testifying, *that* you* should walk worthy of God, who is calling you* into his own kingdom and glory.</p>
<br>
<p>2:13 And because of this, we also are constantly giving-thanks to God, that, when* you* accepted <i>the</i> word of God from our report, you* accepted <i>it</i> not <i>as</i> the word of men, but just-as it truly is, the word of God, which is also working in you* who believe. 
2:14 For* brethren, you* became imitators of the congregations* of God in Christ Jesus, which are in Judea, because you* also suffered the same things by your* own countrymen, just-as they did also by the Jews. 
2:15 <i>The Jews</i>, who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and banished us, and did not please God, and <i>are</i> adverse to all men; 
2:16 forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles in order that they might be saved; *that* they should always fill up their sins, but the wrath has arrived-unexpectedly upon them– to the end.</p>
<br>
<p>2:17 But brethren, having been orphaned from you* in presence, <i>but</i> not in heart, <i>even</i> for a hour’s time, we were even-more diligent to see your* face in much desire. 
2:18 Hence, we wished to come to you*, indeed, I, Paul, both once and twice, and <i>yet</i> the Adversary hindered us. 
2:19 For* what <i>is</i> our hope or joy or crown of boasting, or <i>is it</i> not also you*, <i>which is</i> before our Lord Jesus Christ at his presence? 
2:20 For* you* are our glory and <i>our</i> joy.</p>
<h3>1 Thessalonians 3</h3>
<p>3:1 Hence, no longer forbearing <i>it</i>, we were delighted to be left behind in Athens alone. 
3:2 And we sent Timothy, our brother and God’s servant and fellow worker in the good-news of Christ, *that* he might establish you* and encourage you*, concerning your* faith; 
3:3 that no one be shook up in these afflictions; for* <i>you</i>* yourselves know that we are destined *for this. 
3:4 For* even when we were with you*, we were telling you* beforehand that we are about to be afflicted; just-as it also happened and you* know. 
3:5 Because of this, no longer forbearing <i>it</i>, I also sent <i>Timothy</i>, *that* I might know your* faith, lest the tempter <i>had</i> tempted you*, and our labor might become vain. 
3:6 But now, when* Timothy came to us from you*, and proclaimed to us good-news <i>about</i> your* faith and love*, and that you* have a good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, just-as we also <i>long to see</i> you*. 
3:7 Because of this brethren, we were comforted on <i>the basis of</i> you*, in all our affliction and calamity through your* faith, 
3:8 because now we live, if you* stand-firm in the Lord. 
3:9 For* what thanksgiving are we able to repay to God concerning you*? Over all the joy in which we are rejoicing before our God <i>is</i> because of you*, 
3:10 exceptionally beseeching <i>God</i> night and day, *that* we may see your* face and may mend the things lacking of your* faith.</p>
<br>
<p>3:11 Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus Christ, steer our way toward you*. 
3:12 And may the Lord increase <i>in</i> you* and <i>this increase</i> to abound in love* toward one another and toward all men, just-as we also <i>do</i> toward you*; 
3:13 *that* he might establish your* hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his holy-ones.</p>
<h3>1 Thessalonians 4</h3>
<p>4:1 Then* furthermore brethren, we request and are encouraging you* in the Lord Jesus, even as you* received from us how you* ought to walk and to please God, that* you* might abound <i>even</i> more. 
4:2 For* you* know what commands we gave you* through the Lord Jesus. 
4:3 For* this is <i>the</i> will of God, your* sanctification, <i>for</i> you* to abstain from fornication; 
4:4 <i>for</i> each of you* to know <i>how</i> to procure his own vessel in sanctification and honor, 
4:5 not in the passion of lust, just-as also the Gentiles who do not know God, 
4:6 <i>and</i> not to go beyond limits and takes-advantage of his brother in the matter, because the Lord <i>is</i> an avenger concerning all these things, just-as we <i>have</i> also told to you* beforehand and thoroughly testified. 
4:7 For* God did not call us to uncleanness, but in sanctification. 
4:8 Therefore, he who is rejecting <i>this</i> is not rejecting man, but God, who also gives his Holy Spirit to you*.</p>
<br>
<p>4:9 Now concerning brotherly-love, you* have no need <i>that one</i> writes to you*; for* you* yourselves are taught by God, *that* you* should love* one another; 
4:10 for* you* are also doing it toward all the brethren who <i>are</i> in the whole <i>of</i> Macedonia. But we encourage you*, brethren, that you* abound <i>even</i> more, 
4:11 and that you* make it your aim to be quiet and to do your* own things, and to work with your* own hands (just-as we commanded you*), 
4:12 that* you* may walk decently toward those <i>who are</i> outside, and may have need of nothing.</p>
<br>
<p>4:13 But we do not wish you*, brethren, to be ignorant concerning those who have fallen-asleep; in order that you* may not be sorrowful like the rest who have no hope. 
4:14 For* if we believe that Jesus died and rose* up again, so those who have fallen-asleep through Jesus, God will also bring* together with him. 
4:15 For* this we are saying to you* in <i>the</i> word of <i>the</i> Lord, that we, the living, who are leaving at the presence of the Lord, may never* attain <i>heaven before</i> those who have fallen-asleep. 
4:16 Because the Lord himself will come down from heaven, in a commanding yell, in the voice of the archangel and at the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise* up first; 
4:17 thereafter we, the living, who are leaving, will be taken away at the same time together with them in <i>the</i> clouds, to <i>the</i> encounter of the Lord in the air, and so we will always be together with <i>the</i> Lord. 
4:18 So-then, encourage one another in these words.</p>
<h3>1 Thessalonians 5</h3>
<p>5:1 Now brethren, you* have no need <i>for anything</i> to be written to you* concerning the times and the seasons. 
5:2 For* you yourselves know accurately that the day of the Lord so comes like a thief in the night. 
5:3 For* whenever they are saying, Peace and security; then sudden utter-ruin stands by them, just-like having travail in <i>the</i> womb, and they may never* flee away from <i>it</i>. 
5:4 But brethren, you* are not in darkness, that* the day might overtake you* like a thief. 
5:5 You* are all sons of light and sons of <i>the</i> day. We are not of the night, nor of darkness; 
5:6 then* consequently*, do not sleep, like the rest also do, but we should watch and should be sober. 
5:7 For* those who are sleeping, sleep in the night, and those who are drunken, are drunken in the night. 
5:8 But we, being of <i>the</i> day, should be sober; having clothed yourselves with the breastplate of faith and love*, and the hope of salvation like a helmet. 
5:9 Because God appointed* us not *for wrath, but *for the acquisition of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
5:10 who died on our behalf, that*, whether we should watch or sleep, we should live at the same time together with him. 
5:11 Hence, encourage one another and build each other up, just-as you* are also doing.</p>
<br>
<p>5:12 But we request of you*, brethren, to know those who are laboring among you*, and are governing over you*, and admonishing you* in the Lord; 
5:13 and to deem them exceptionally in love* because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 
5:14 But brethren, we encourage you*, admonish the disorderly, console the fainthearted, hold up the weak, have patience toward all. 
5:15 See that not anyone repays evil in exchange-for evil to anyone, but always pursue the good, both toward one another and toward all. 
5:16 Rejoice always. 
5:17 Pray constantly. 
5:18 Give-thanks in everything; for* this <i>is</i> the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you*. 
5:19 Do not quench the Spirit. 
5:20 Do not scorn prophesying. 
5:21 Test all things. Hold-onto what is good. 
5:22 Abstain from every form of evil.</p>
<br>
<p>5:23 Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you* entirely, and may your* whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
5:24 <i>He is</i> faithful who calls you*, who will also do <i>it</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>5:25 Brethren, pray concerning us.</p>
<br>
<p>5:26 Greet all the brethren by a holy kiss. 
5:27 I am imploring you* <i>by</i> the Lord <i>that</i> this letter be read to all the holy brethren.</p>
<br>
<p>5:28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you*. Amen.</p>

<h3>2 Thessalonians 1</h3>
<p>1:1 Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the congregation* of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: 
1:2 Grace to you* and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>1:3 We always ought to thank God concerning you* brethren, just-as it is worthy, because your* faith is growing substantially, and the love* of each one of you* all toward one another is increasing; 
1:4 so-that we ourselves boast in you* in the congregations* of God, on behalf of your* endurance and faith in all your* persecutions, and in the afflictions which you* are tolerating. 
1:5 <i>This is</i> an example of the righteous judgment of God; *that* you* may be deemed worthy of the kingdom of God, on behalf of which you* are also suffering; 
1:6 if indeed* <i>it is</i> a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who are afflicting you*; 
1:7 and to you* who are afflicted with us, a rest at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with <i>the</i> messengers of his power, 
1:8 giving vengeance in a fire of flame {i.e. in flaming fire} to those who do not know God and to those who are not obeying* the good-news of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
1:9 who will suffer-punishment, the sentence of everlasting utter-ruin away from the face of the Lord, and away from the glory of his strength, 
1:10 whenever he may come to be glorified in his holy-ones, and to be marveled <i>at</i> in that day in all those who have believed, (because our testimony to you* was believed). 
1:11 Also, toward this <i>end</i>, we are always praying concerning you*, that* our God might deem you* worthy of your* calling, and might fulfill every delight of goodness, and <i>every</i> work of faith, in power, 
1:12 *that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ might be glorified in you*, and you* in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h3>2 Thessalonians 2</h3>
<p>2:1 Now we request of you*, brethren, on behalf of the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him, 
2:2 *that* you* might not be quickly shaken from your* mind, nor be alarmed, (either through spirit, or through word, or through letter, as <i>if it came</i> through us), as that the day of the Christ is present. 
2:3 Do not let anyone deceive you* in any manner, that <i>day will not come,</i> if the apostasy does not come first and the man of sin should be revealed, the son of destruction, 
2:4 he who lays in opposition to <i>us</i> and promotes himself against all <i>which is</i> called* a god or worshiped objects; so-that he sits in the temple of God as a god, showing himself– that he is a god. 
2:5 Do you* not remember that when* I was yet with you*, I was speaking to you* <i>about</i> these things? 
2:6 And now you* know what is holding <i>it</i> back, *that* he may be revealed in his own time. 
2:7 For* the mystery of lawlessness is already working; only <i>there is</i> one who is holding <i>it</i> back now, until he should become from the midst <i>of us</i>. 
2:8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will consume with the breath of his mouth and will do-away-with <i>him</i> by the appearing of his presence; 
2:9 <i>even he</i>, whose presence is according to <i>the</i> working of the Adversary in every power and in <i>the</i> signs and in lying wonders, 
2:10 and in all deception of unrighteousness in those who are perishing, because they did not accept the love* of the truth, *that* they might be saved. 
2:11 And because of this, God will send them a working of error, *that* they may believe in the lie; 
2:12 that* they all might be judged who did not believe the truth, but were delighted in unrighteousness.</p>
<br>
<p>2:13 But we ought to thank God concerning you* brethren, beloved by <i>the</i> Lord, that God himself selected you* from the beginning to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and in faith of <i>the</i> truth; 
2:14 to which he called you* through our good-news, *for the acquisition of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2:15 Then* *, brethren, stand-firm and hold-fast the traditions which you* were taught, whether through speech or through our letter.</p>
<br>
<p>2:16 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God and Father who loved* us and gave <i>us</i> everlasting comfort and good hope in grace, 
2:17 may comfort your* hearts and may establish them in all <i>the</i> word and good work.</p>
<h3>2 Thessalonians 3</h3>
<p>3:1 Furthermore, brethren, pray concerning us, that* the word of the Lord may run <i>onward</i> and may be glorified, just-as <i>it is</i> also with you*; 
3:2 and that* we may be rescued from the improper and evil men; for* the faith <i>is</i> not of all. 
3:3 But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you* and guard you* from the evil <i>one.</i> 
3:4 Now we have confidence in the Lord on <i>the basis of</i> you*, that you* are both doing and will practice the things which we command you*. 
3:5 Now may the Lord steer your* hearts into the love* of God and into <i>the</i> endurance of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>3:6 Now brethren, we are commanding you* in <i>the</i> name of our Lord Jesus Christ: you* <i>are</i> to withdraw yourselves from every brother who is walking disorderly and not according to the tradition which they received from us. 
3:7 For* <i>you</i>* yourselves know how it is essential <i>for</i> you* to imitate us. Because we did not act-disorderly among you*; 
3:8 neither did we eat bread freely from anyone’s hand, but in labor and hardship, working night and day, *that* we might not burden anyone of you*; 
3:9 not because we did not have the authority, but that* we might give ourselves as an example to you*, *that* you* might imitate us. 
3:10 For* even when we were with you*, this we were commanding you*, If anyone is not willing to work, neither let him eat. 
3:11 For* we hear <i>there are</i> some who are walking disorderly among you*, working <i>at</i> nothing, but are busybodies. 
3:12 Now we are commanding to such and are encouraging through our Lord Jesus Christ, that* they work with quietness and should eat their own bread. 
3:13 But you* brethren, do not be depressed <i>in</i> doing good. 
3:14 And if anyone is not obeying* our word through this letter, mark that man and do not socialize together with him, in order that he may be embarrassed. 
3:15 And <i>yet</i> do not deem <i>him</i> as an enemy, but admonish <i>him</i> like a brother.</p>
<br>
<p>3:16 Now the Lord of peace himself may give you* peace always <i>and</i> in every manner. The Lord <i>be</i> with all of you*.</p>
<br>
<p>3:17 The greeting from me, Paul, I thus am writing with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter. 
3:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you* all. Amen.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>1 Timothy 1</h3>
<p>1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the commandment of God our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ, our hope; 
1:2 to Timothy, <i>my</i> genuine child in <i>the</i> faith: grace, mercy, peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>1:3 As I encouraged you to remain in Ephesus, <i>when I was</i> traveling into Macedonia, that* you might command to some not to teach a different teaching, 
1:4 nor to take-heed to fables and unending genealogies, which provide <i>more</i> debates, rather than a stewardship of God which <i>is</i> in faith. 
1:5 But the end of the command is love* out of a clean heart and a good conscience and a non-pretended faith; 
1:6 from which some having deviated, turned aside to empty-talking; 
1:7 wishing to be teachers of the law, perceiving neither what they are saying, nor <i>the things</i> concerning what they are confidently confirming. 
1:8 But we know that the law is good, if anyone uses it lawfully, 
1:9 knowing this: that law is not laid <i>down</i> {Or: destined} for <i>the</i> righteous, but for the lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, <i>for</i> killers of their fathers and killers of their mothers, for murderers, 
1:10 for fornicators, for homosexuals, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers and if any other which lays in opposition to sound* teaching; 
1:11 according to the good-news of the glory of the blessed* God, <i>to</i> which I was entrusted.</p>
<br>
<p>1:12 And I have gratitude <i>to</i> the one who empowered me, <i>namely,</i> Christ Jesus our Lord, because he deemed me faithful, placing me into <i>his</i> service; 
1:13 <i>even though</i> I was a former blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent <i>man</i>, but I was shown-mercy, because I did <i>it</i> being ignorant in unbelief; 
1:14 and the grace of our Lord overwhelmed <i>me</i> with <i>the</i> faith and love* which is in Christ Jesus. 
1:15 Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost. 
1:16 But I was shown-mercy because of this, that* in me <i>as</i> foremost, Jesus Christ might show all his patience, for a pattern of those who are <i>afterward</i> about to believe on him *for everlasting life. 
1:17 Now to the King everlasting, incorruptible, invisible, the only wise God, <i>is</i> honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>1:18 I consign this command to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophesies preceding upon you, that* you may be warring the good warfare by them; 
1:19 having faith and a good conscience, which some have thrust away, are shipwrecked concerning the faith; 
1:20 of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I gave to the Adversary, that* they might be disciplined not to blaspheme.</p>
<br>
<h3>1 Timothy 2</h3>
<p>2:1 Therefore I encourage first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made* on behalf of all men, 
2:2 on behalf of kings and all who are in superior-stations; that* we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness* and honesty. 
2:3 For* this is good and acceptable in God our Savior’s sight; 
2:4 who wishes all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of <i>the</i> truth. 
2:5 For* <i>there is</i> one God, one intermediary of God and of men, <i>the</i> man, Christ Jesus, 
2:6 who gave himself <i>as</i> a ransom on behalf of all; the testimony <i>given</i> in its own times; 
2:7 to which I was appointed* a preacher and an apostle, (I am speaking <i>the</i> truth in Christ, I am not lying), <i>and</i> a teacher of the nations in faith and truth.</p>
<br>
<p>2:8 {F} Therefore I will that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and <i>evil</i> reasoning.</p>
<p>2:9 Likewise* also, <i>let</i> the women adorn themselves in a respectable array, with modesty and self-discipline; not in <i>hair</i> braids or gold or pearls or costly garments; 
2:10 but what is suitable to women professing godliness through good works. 
2:11 Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection. 
2:12 Now I do not permit a woman to teach, nor to dominate a man, but to be in quietness.</p>
<p>2:13 For* Adam was first molded, thereafter Eve; 
2:14 and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, has become <i>the one</i> in transgression; 
2:15 but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they remain in faith and love* and sanctification with self-discipline.</p>
<br>
<p>{Footnotes: 1Tim 2:8-12 is probably meant in a religious place or congregation* otherwise verse 12 would be a Bible contradiction.}</p>
<h3>1 Timothy 3</h3>
<p>{1Tim 3:1-7 &amp; Titus 1:5-9 Congregational leaders.}</p>
<p>{‘Unimpeachable,’ (below, G423), ‘irreproachable,’ (Tit 1, G410), are both in the qualifications of the Lord’s earthly congregation’s leadership, described in various Bible versions and locations within as: elders, bishops, overseers, pastors, shepherds, presbyters; (all terms are always plural in the Bible). These words do not translate well into English. They are simply a description of a person not under an accusation by an enemy or legal system or better as under any kind of accusation, this person is blameless, guiltless and has an impeccable reputation. Another note: ‘children’ is plural in Greek.}</p>
<p>3:1 Faithful is the word, If a certain <i>man</i> is aspiring to the overseership, he is desiring a good work. 
3:2 Therefore, it is essential <i>for</i> the overseer to be: unimpeachable, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, orderly, hospitable, skilled in teaching; 
3:3 not a drunkard, not a bully, not covetous, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a money-lover; 
3:4 one who is governing his own house well, having <i>his</i> children in subjection with all honesty; 
3:5 (but if anyone does not know how to govern his own house, how will he care for the congregation* of God?;) 
3:6 not a new-convert, (that* when* he is puffed up, he might not fall into the condemnation of the Devil). 
3:7 But it is also essential for him to have a good testimony from those who are outside <i>the congregation</i>*; that* he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil.</p>
<p>{Deacons, is a transliteration of the Greek word diakonos G1249. This word and its compounds in all other contexts are translated ‘serve,' ‘servant,' or ‘service’ (see 
3:10 &amp; 3:13). Because ‘elder’ (‘overseer’ in Php 1:1) a known office of the congregation is used, this context calls for an office or serving position in the congregation. The actual word in Greek means ‘servant’ who serves in reference to his job. The same word is used by Paul to describe a ‘policeman’ (in modern terms) in Rom. 13:4. Context could also mean ‘those who minister,’ in general. Other Greek synonyms in the MLV are translated ‘domestic servant,’ ‘attendant,’ ‘minister*’ and ‘bondservant.’}</p>
<p>3:8 Deacons* likewise* <i>must be</i> honorable, not double-tongued, not taking-heed to much wine, not covetous; 
3:9 holding the mystery of the faith in a clean conscience. 
3:10 But let these also first be tested; thereafter let them serve, if they are irreproachable.</p>
<p>3:11 <i>Their</i> wives likewise* <i>must be</i> honorable, not slanderers, <i>but</i> temperate, faithful in all things.</p>
<p>3:12 Let deacons be husbands of one wife, governing <i>their</i> children and their own houses well. 
3:13 For* those who have served well acquire for themselves a good rank and much boldness in <i>the</i> faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>3:14 I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you shortly; 
3:15 but if I am slow, that* you may know how men ought to conduct themselves in the house of God, which is the congregation* of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. 
3:16 And confessedly great is the mystery of godliness*: God was manifested in <i>the</i> flesh, was justified in <i>the</i> spirit, was seen by messengers, was preached among the nations, was believed <i>on</i> in the world, was received up in glory.</p>
<h3>1 Timothy 4</h3>
<p>4:1 But the Spirit expressly says, <b>In later times some will withdraw from the faith, taking-heed to misleading spirits and teachings of demons,</b> 
4:2  <b>through the hypocrisy from <i>the</i> speakers of lies, having been branded in their own conscience;</b> 
4:3  <b>forbidding to marry <i>and commanding</i> to abstain from food, which God created *for reception with thanksgiving by those who believe and have recognized the truth,</b> 
4:4 <b>because every created thing of God <i>is</i> good and casting off nothing if it is received with thanksgiving,</b> 
4:5 <b>for* it is sanctified through the word of God and <i>through</i> intercession.</b></p>
<p>4:6 If you suggest to the brethren these things, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of the faith and of the good teaching which you have followed closely. 
4:7 But renounce profane and old-wives’ fables and exercise yourself to godliness*; 
4:8 for* bodily exercise is profitable for few <i>things</i>, but godliness* is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which <i>is</i> now and the future <i>one</i>.</p>
<p>4:9 Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance. 
4:10 For* we are also laboring and are reproached toward this <i>end</i>, because we have hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe. 
4:11 Command and teach these things.</p>
<br>
<p>4:12 Let no one despise your youth, but become an example, in word, in spirit, in conduct, in love*, in faith, in purity, to those who believe. 
4:13 Until I come, take-heed to public-reading, to encouragement, to teaching. 
4:14 Do not neglect the gift* <i>which is</i> in you, which was given to you through prophecy, with <i>the</i> laying on of the hands of the eldership. 
4:15 Meditate on these things; be <i>diligent</i> in them; that* your progress may be apparent to all. 
4:16 Take-heed to yourself and to your teaching. Abide in these things; for* <i>in</i> practicing this, you will save both yourself and those who hear you.</p>
<h3>1 Timothy 5</h3>
<p>5:1 Do not berate an elder <i>man</i>, but encourage him like a father; the younger-men like brethren; 
5:2 the elder <i>women</i> like mothers; the younger <i>women</i> like sisters, in all purity. 
5:3 Honor widows who are really widows. 
5:4 But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to be devout toward their own family and to give back reimbursement to their parents; for* this is acceptable in God’s sight. 
5:5 Now she who really is a widow and has been <i>left</i> alone and remains in supplications and prayers night and day has <i>her</i> hope in God. 
5:6 But she who is self-indulgent, <i>is</i> living, <i>but</i> has died. 
5:7 Also command these things, in order that they may be unimpeachable. 
5:8 But if anyone is not {F} planning-for his own and especially his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse <i>than</i> an unbeliever. 
5:9 Let no one be enrolled as a widow <i>who is</i> less than sixty years old, having become the wife of one man, 
5:10 being testified of in good works; if she has reared children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the holy-ones’ feet, if she has relieved <i>those</i> being afflicted, if she has followed after every good work.</p>
<p>5:11 But renounce younger widows; for* whenever they are promiscuous against Christ, they wish to marry; 
5:12 having condemnation, because they have rejected <i>their</i> first faith. 
5:13 Now at the same time, they also are learning <i>to be</i> idle, strolling from house to house, and not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not <i>to speak</i>. 
5:14 Therefore I will that the younger <i>widows</i> marry, to be childbearing, to manage the house, to give no starting-point to those who lay in opposition to <i>them</i> because of reviling: 
5:15 for* already some have turned aside after the Adversary.</p>
<p>5:16 If any believing <i>man</i> or believing <i>woman</i> has <i>relatives who are</i> widows, they should relieve them and do not let the congregation* be burdened; that* it may relieve those who really are widows.</p>
<br>
<p>5:17 The elders who are governing well, let them be deemed worthy of double honor, especially those who are laboring in the word and in teaching. 
5:18 For* the Scripture says, ‘You will not muzzle a threshing bull.’ {Deu. 25:4} And, ‘The worker is worthy of his wages.’ {Lev. 19:13} 
5:19 Do not accept an accusation against an elder, unless upon <i>the testimony of</i> two or three witnesses. 
5:20 Reprove those who are sinning in the sight of all, that* the rest may also be in fear. 
5:21 I am thoroughly testifying in sight of God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the chosen messengers, that* you should observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing according to bias. 
5:22 Lay hands on no one quickly, nor share in another’s sins. Keep yourself pure! 
5:23 No longer be a drinker of water <i>only</i>, but use a small <i>amount of</i> wine because of your stomach and your frequent sicknesses. 
5:24 Some men’s sins are evident, leading <i>them</i> to judgment, but even for some, they <i>will</i> follow after <i>them later</i>. 
5:25 Likewise* also, good works are evident, and those that are contrariwise, is not able to be hid.</p>

<h3>1 Timothy 6</h3>
<p>6:1 Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke deem their own masters worthy of all honor, that* the name of God and the teaching may not be blasphemed. 
6:2 But those who have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren, but rather let them serve* them, because they are believing and beloved who are being helped <i>by your</i> good* work. Teach and encourage these things.</p>
<br>
<p>6:3 If anyone is teaching a different teaching and is not coming near to sound* words, <i>even</i> the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the teaching which is according to godliness*; 
6:4 he has been puffed up, knowing nothing, but being mentally diseased concerning debates and quarrels over words, out of which become: envy, strife, blasphemies, evil suspicions, 
6:5 incessant wrangling of men who have been corrupted in the mind and who have been deprived of the truth, supposing that godliness* <i>is</i> a method to earnings. Withdraw yourself from such.</p>
<p>6:6 But godliness* with contentment is a great method to earnings; 
6:7 for* we brought nothing into the world, nor <i>it is</i> evident that we are able to carry anything out; 
6:8 but we will be content with these, having nourishment and clothes. 
6:9 But those who plan to be rich are falling into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, which are submerging men into utter-ruin and <i>everlasting</i> destruction. 
6:10 For* the love of money is a root of all <i>kinds</i> of evils; of which some aspiring to, have been misled from the faith and they themselves are staked-through by many sorrows.</p>
<br>
<p>6:11 But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness*, faith, love*, endurance, meekness. 
6:12 Fight the good fight of the faith, grab the everlasting life, to which you were called and professed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses. 
6:13 I am commanding you in God’s sight, who gives-life to all things and of Christ Jesus, who in front of Pontius Pilate testified the good confession; 
6:14 that you keep the commandment, unstained, unimpeachable, till the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
6:15 Which in its own times, he will show, the Blessed* and only Sovereign, the King of those who are reigning, and a Lord of those who have lordship over <i>others</i>; 
6:16 <i>he</i> who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no one has seen, nor is able to see: to whom <i>is</i> honor and everlasting dominion. Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>6:17 Command those who are rich in this current world, not to be cavalier, nor to have hope on the uncertainty of riches, but <i>have hope</i> in the living God, who is richly providing to us all things toward enjoyment; 
6:18 <i>also command them</i> to work <i>what is</i>  good, to be rich in good works, to be liberal in giving, generous, 
6:19 storing up for themselves a good foundation toward the future, that* they may grab everlasting life.</p>
<br>
<p>6:20 O Timothy, guard the deposit consigned <i>to you</i>, turning away from the profane empty-talks and oppositions of the falsely named knowledge; 
6:21 which some professing have deviated concerning the faith.</p>
<br>
<p>Grace <i>be</i> with you. Amen.</p>

<h3>2 Timothy 1</h3>
<p>1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus. 
1:2 To Timothy, <i>my</i> beloved child: grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>1:3 I have gratitude to God, whom I give-divine service from my ancestors in a clean conscience, how constant is my remembrance concerning you in my supplications, night and day. 
1:4 <i>I am</i> longing to see you, having remembered your tears, that* I may be filled from joy; 
1:5 receiving a reminder of <i>the</i> non-pretended faith, which is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, now I also have confidence <i>it is</i> in you. 
1:6 Because of which cause, I am reminding you to rekindle the gift* of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 
1:7 For* God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and love* and self-discipline. 
1:8 Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, his prisoner, but suffer-hardship together with the good-news according to the power of God, 
1:9 who saved us and called <i>us</i> with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given <i>to</i> us in Christ Jesus before times everlasting, 
1:10 but now has been made manifest through the appearing of our Savior, Jesus Christ, who indeed has done-away-with death <i>and</i> has illuminated <i>both</i> life and incorruption through the good-news, 
1:11 to which I was appointed* a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of <i>the</i> Gentiles. 
1:12 Because of which cause, I also am suffering these things <i>too</i>, but I am not ashamed; for* I know him whom I have believed and I have confidence that he is able to guard my deposit consigned <i>to him</i> to that day. 
1:13 Hold <i>to</i> the pattern of sound* words which you have heard from me, in faith and love* which is in Christ Jesus. 
1:14 Guard the good deposit consigned <i>to you</i> through the Holy Spirit who is dwelling in us.</p>
<br>
<p>1:15 You know this, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. 
1:16 May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain; 
1:17 but, when* he happened <i>to be</i> in Rome, he diligently sought me and found me, 
1:18 (may the Lord give to him to find mercy from the Lord in that day), and how-much he served <i>me</i> in Ephesus, you know <i>this</i> quite-well.</p>
<h3>2 Timothy 2</h3>
<p>2:1 You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which <i>is</i> in Christ Jesus. 
2:2 And the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, consign these to faithful men, who will also be competent to teach others. 
2:3 Therefore suffer evil treatment as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 
2:4 No active soldier entangles himself in the {F} tradeoffs of <i>this</i> life, that* he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier. 
2:5 And if anyone also contends <i>in the games</i>, he is not crowned, if he has not contended lawfully. 
2:6 It is essential <i>that</i> the farmer who labors to receive of the fruits first. 
2:7 Perceive the things I am saying; for* the Lord may give you intelligence in all things. 
2:8 Remember Jesus Christ, who has been raised from the dead, <i>was born</i> out of <i>the</i> seed of David, according to my good-news; 
2:9 in which I am suffering evil treatment, <i>even</i> as far as bonds, like a criminal, but the word of God has not been bound. 
2:10 Because of this, I endure all things, because of the chosen, that* they may also obtain the salvation which <i>is</i> in Christ Jesus with everlasting glory. 
2:11 Faithful is the word, For* if we died together with <i>him</i>, we will also live together with <i>him</i>: 
2:12 if we endure, we will also reign together with <i>him</i>; if we are denying <i>him</i>, he will also deny us; 
2:13 if we are unfaithful, that one is remaining faithful; he is not able to deny himself.</p>
<br>
<p>2:14 Remind them of these things, thoroughly testifying in the sight of the Lord, <i>that they are</i> not to quarrel over words, <i>which is</i> useful in nothing, <i>but leads</i> to the catastrophe of those who hear. 
2:15 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed worker, {F} cutting-straight the word of truth. 
2:16 But avoid profane empty-talks; for* they will progress more in ungodliness, 
2:17 and their word will eat-away like gangrene; of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus. 
2:18 Men who have deviated concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection has happened already and are perverting the faith of some. 
2:19 Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal, ‘The Lord knows those who are his,’ {Num. 16:5} and ‘Let everyone who names the name of the Lord withdraw from unrighteousness.’ {Isa 26:13} 
2:20 Now vessels are not only golden and silver in a great house, but also wooden and clay, and some to honor but others to dishonor. 
2:21 Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel *for honor, having been sanctified and useful to the master, having been prepared *for every good work. 
2:22 But flee the youthful lusts; pursue righteousness, faith, love*, <i>and</i> peace, with those who are calling upon the Lord out of a clean heart. 
2:23 But renounce foolish and non-instructive debates, knowing that they give-birth to quarrels. 
2:24 But it is essential <i>for</i> the Lord’s bondservant to not quarrel, but to be mild toward all, skilled in teaching, tolerating <i>it when</i> being mistreated, 
2:25 in meekness {F} educating those who are placing themselves in opposition; <i>if</i> maybe God might give them repentance <i>to come</i> to the full knowledge of the truth, 
2:26 and they might sober up out of the snare of the Devil, having been caught live by him to that <i>man’s</i> will.</p>

<h3>2 Timothy 3</h3>
<p>3:1 But know this, that in the last days grievous times will be present. 
3:2 For* men will be lovers of themselves, money-lovers, boasters, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
3:3 cold-hearted, implacable, slanderers, with no self-control, untamed, not lovers of good, 
3:4 betrayers, rash, having been puffed up, loving sensual-delights rather than loving God; 
3:5 holding <i>to</i> a form of godliness*, but having denied its power. Now turn away from these <i>people</i>. 
3:6 For* out of these <i>people</i> are those who are sneaking into houses and capturing immature women, <i>who</i> have been piled up with sins <i>and</i> are led away by various lusts, 
3:7 always learning and never being able to come to the full knowledge of the truth. 
3:8 Now in the manner <i>that</i> Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses so also, are these standing against the truth. Men having been utterly corrupted in mind, unapproved concerning the faith. 
3:9 But they will progress no more-than <i>this</i>. For* their mindlessness will be obvious to all men, as that of those <i>men</i> also became.</p>
<p>3:10 But you have followed closely my teaching, lead, purpose, faith, patience, love*, endurance, 
3:11 persecutions <i>and</i> sufferings, such-as happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, <i>and</i> in Lystra. I underwent <i>many</i> persecutions such-as <i>these</i>, and the Lord rescued me out of all <i>of them.</i> 
3:12 But even all who wish to live devoutly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 
3:13 But evil men and impostors will progress <i>from bad</i> to worse, misleading and being misled. 
3:14 But you, abide in the things which you have learned and were entrusted with, having known from whom you have learned <i>them</i>. 
3:15 And you have known, that from a baby, the sacred Scriptures which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>3:16 All Scripture is God breathed and <i>is</i> profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for education which <i>is</i> in righteousness, 
3:17 in order that the man of God may be equipped, having been utterly equipped *for every good work.</p>
<h3>2 Timothy 4</h3>
<p>4:1 Therefore, I am thoroughly testifying in the sight of God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is about to judge the living and the dead according to his appearing and his kingdom. 
4:2 Preach the word. Stand-ready opportunely and inopportunely. Reprove, rebuke <i>and</i> encourage in all patience and teaching. 
4:3 For* the time will come when they will not tolerate the sound teaching, but having itchy ears, will pile up for themselves teachers according to their own lusts; 
4:4 and will indeed turn their hearing away from the truth and turn aside to fables. 
4:5 But you, be sober in all things, suffer evil treatment, do the work of an evangelist, fully assure your service.</p>
<p>4:6 For* I am already a drink-offering and the time of my departure stands-ready. 
4:7 I have fought the good fight. I have completed the course. I have kept the faith. 
4:8 Furthermore the crown of righteousness is laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to all those who have loved* his appearing.</p>
<br>
<p>4:9 Be diligent to come to me shortly; 
4:10 for* Demas forsook me and traveled to Thessalonica, having loved* this current age; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. 
4:11 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring* him with you; for* he is useful to me *for service. 
4:12 But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus. 
4:13 Bring the coat that I left in Troas with Carpus when* you come and <i>also bring</i> the books, especially the parchments. 
4:14 Alexander the coppersmith showed to me many evils. May the Lord give to him according to his works; 
4:15 whom you also, guard yourself <i>against</i>; for* he is exceedingly standing against our words. 
4:16 In my first defense no one came together <i>for my defense</i>, but all forsook me; may it not be counted <i>against</i> them. 
4:17 But the Lord stood beside me and empowered me; that* the preaching might be fully assured through me and <i>that</i>* all the Gentiles might hear and I was rescued out of the mouth of the lion. 
4:18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil work and will save me *for his heavenly kingdom: to whom <i>is</i> the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>4:19 Greet Prisca and Aquila and the house of Onesiphorus. 
4:20 Erastus remained in Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick in Miletus. 
4:21 Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus greets you and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.</p>
<br>
<p>4:22 The Lord Jesus Christ, <i>be</i> with your spirit. Grace <i>be</i> with you*. Amen.</p>

<h3>Titus 1</h3>
<p>1:1 Paul, a bondservant of God and apostle of Jesus Christ, according to <i>the</i> faith of God’s chosen and the full knowledge of <i>the</i> truth which is according to godliness*, 
1:2 upon <i>the</i> hope of everlasting life, which God, <i>who is</i> incapable of lying, promised before times everlasting.</p>
<p>1:3 But in his own seasons, he manifested his word in <i>the</i> preaching in which I was entrusted, according to the commandment of God our Savior.</p>
<p>1:4 To Titus, my genuine child according to <i>the</i> common faith: grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior.</p>
<p>1:5 Because of this, I left you in Crete, that* you might amend the things which are deficient and should designate elders in every city, as I commanded you. 
1:6 If anyone is irreproachable, the husband of one wife, having believing children, <i>who is</i> not in an accusation of riotousness or rebellious. 
1:7 For* it is essential <i>for</i> the overseer to be irreproachable as God’s steward; not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not a drunkard, not a bully, not covetous; 
1:8 but hospitable, who loves good, sensible, just, holy, self-controlled; 
1:9 holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that* he may be able both to encourage in the sound teaching and to convict those who contradict <i>it</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>1:10 For* there are many even rebellious men, empty-talkers and deceivers, especially those out of <i>the</i> circumcision, 
1:11 whom it is essential to gag; men who are perverting whole houses, teaching things which they ought not <i>teach</i>, because of shameful covetous. 
1:12 Someone from their own, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are liars habitually, evil beasts, idle gluttons. 
1:13 This testimony is true. Because of which cause, reprove them sharply, that* they may be sound in the faith, 
1:14 not taking-heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. 
1:15 Indeed, all things are clean to the clean, but nothing is clean to those who have been defiled and <i>are</i> unbelieving, but both their mind and their conscience have been defiled. 
1:16 They profess that they know God, but they are denying him by their works, being detestable and disobedient and unapproved toward every good work.</p>
<h3>Titus 2</h3>
<p>2:1 But <i>as for</i> you, speak the things which are suitable to the sound teaching. 
2:2 <i>Teach</i> that elderly-men <i>are</i> to be temperate, honorable, sensible, sound in faith, in love*, in endurance.</p>
<p>2:3 Likewise*, <i>teach</i> that elderly-women <i>are</i> to be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor have been enslaved to much wine, <i>but</i> teachers of what is good, 
2:4 that* they may train the young <i>women</i> to be lovers of <i>their</i> husbands, to love <i>their</i> children, 
2:5 <i>and to be</i> sensible, pure, homemakers, <i>and</i> kind, being subject to their own husbands, that* the word of God may not be blasphemed. 
2:6 Likewise* encourage the younger-men to be sensible, 
2:7 providing yourself as an example of good works concerning all things; in the teaching <i>have</i> integrity, honesty, incorruption, 
2:8 sound speech <i>which is</i> not condemnable; that* he might be embarrassed <i>who is</i> from <i>the</i> adverse <i>side</i>, having no evil thing to say concerning us.</p>
<p>2:9 <i>Encourage</i> a bondservant to be subject to their own masters and to be well pleasing <i>to them</i> in all things, not contradicting <i>them</i>; 
2:10 not pilfering <i>things</i>, but showing all good faith<i>fulness</i>; that* they may adorn the teaching of God our Savior in all things. 
2:11 For* the grace of God has appeared, which <i>is</i> salvation to all men, 
2:12 educating us that*, (having denied ungodliness and worldly lusts), we should live with self-discipline and righteously and devoutly in this current world; 
2:13 waiting for the blessed* hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ; 
2:14 who gave himself on our behalf, that* he might redeem us from all lawlessness and might cleanse a treasured people for himself, zealous of good works. 
2:15 Speak and encourage and reprove these things with every commandment. Let no one despise you.</p>
<h3>Titus 3</h3>
<p>3:1 Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to be obedient, to be prepared *for every good work, 
3:2 to blaspheme no one, not quarrelsome, <i>but</i> to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men. 
3:3 For* we were also previously foolish, disobedient, being misled, serving* in various lusts and sensual-delights, leading <i>lives</i> in malice and envy, spiteful, hating one another. 
3:4 But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love of mankind had appeared: 
3:5 he saved us (not from <i>any</i> works <i>done</i> in righteousness, which we practiced), but according to his mercy, through the bath of rebirth and renewal of the Holy Spirit, 
3:6 which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior; 
3:7 that*, having been justified by that grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of everlasting life. 
3:8 Faithful is the word, and I will <i>that</i> you, to confidently confirm concerning these things, that* those who have believed God may be anxious to first establish themselves in good works. These things are good and profitable to men. 
3:9 But avoid foolish debates and genealogies and strifes and quarrels about-law; for* they are unprofitable and futile. 
3:10 Renounce a sectarian man after a first and second admonition; 
3:11 knowing that such a one has been perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned.</p>
<br>
<p>3:12 Whenever I send Artemas to you or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me in Nicopolis; for* I have decided to winter there. 
3:13 Send Zenas the professor of the law and Apollos onward diligently that* nothing may be deficient for them. 
3:14 But let our <i>people</i> also learn to first establish themselves in good works *for necessary needs, that* they may not be unfruitful.</p>
<br>
<p>3:15 All who are with me greet you*. Greet those who love us in <i>the</i> faith.</p>
<br>
<p>Grace <i>be</i> with you* all. Amen.</p>

<h3>Philemon</h3>
<p>1:1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow worker, 
1:2 and to Apphia the beloved and to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the congregation* in your house: 
1:3 grace to you* and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>1:4 I am always giving-thanks to my God, making* a remembrance of you in my prayers, 
1:5 hearing of your love* and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the holy-ones; 
1:6 *that the fellowship of your faith might become effective in the full knowledge of every good thing, which is in you*, to Christ Jesus. 
1:7 For* we have much gratitude and comfort in your love*, because the hearts* of the holy-ones have been given-rest through you, brother.</p>
<br>
<p>1:8 Hence, having much boldness in Christ to command you what is proper, 
1:9 yet because of love* I <i>would</i> rather encourage <i>you</i>, being such a one as Paul <i>the</i> elderly-man and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. 
1:10 I am encouraging you concerning my child, whom I have fathered in my bonds, Onesimus, 
1:11 who was not useful to you previously, but is useful to you now and to me whom I have sent back <i>to you</i>. 
1:12 But you, receive him, that is, my heart*; 
1:13 whom I was planning to hold <i>here</i> for myself, that* he might serve me in the bonds of the good-news on your behalf. 
1:14 But I wished to do nothing without your viewpoint; that* your good <i>deed</i> may not be as according to necessity, but willfully. 
1:15 For* perhaps because of this, he was separated <i>from you</i> for a season, in order that you may have him <i>in the</i> everlasting <i>world</i>; 
1:16 no longer as a bondservant, but beyond a bondservant, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 
1:17 Therefore, if you have me <i>like</i> a partner, receive him like myself. 
1:18 But if he has wronged you <i>in</i> anything or owes <i>you anything</i>, charge this to my account. 
1:19 I, Paul, write <i>it</i> with my own hand. I will compensate <i>you</i>; in order that I may not say to you, You are even owing yourself to me. 
1:20 Yes, brother, let me derive benefit from you in the Lord. Give-rest to my heart* in <i>the</i> Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>1:21 I write to you, having confidence in your obedience, knowing that you will do even beyond what I am saying. 
1:22 But also at the same time, prepare me a lodging. For* I am hoping that through your* prayers I will be granted to you*.</p>
<br>
<p>1:23 Epaphras, my fellow captive in Christ Jesus, greets you; 
1:24 <i>so do</i> my fellow workers Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke.</p>
<br>
<p>1:25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with your* spirit. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hebrews 1</h3>
<p>1:1 God, who long-ago spoke, in many parts and in many manners, in the prophets to the fathers, has in the end of these days, spoken to us in <i>his</i> Son, 
1:2 whom he appointed* heir of all things, through whom also he made* the ages. 
1:3 <i>It is he</i> who, being the brightness of his glory and the exact representation of his essence, and <i>is</i> carrying all things by his declaration of power. Having made* a cleansing of our sins through himself, he sat down by <i>the</i> right <i>hand</i> of the Majesty in <i>the</i> high <i>place</i>; 
1:4 having become so-much better <i>than</i> the messengers, inasmuch as he has inherited a more excellent name than they.</p>
<p>1:5 For* to which of the messengers has he previously said, ‘You are my Son; I have fathered you today.’? And again, ‘I will be a Father to him and he will be a Son to me.’? {Psa 2:7, 89:26, 27} 
1:6 And again, whenever he brought* the firstborn into the inhabited-earth, he says, ‘And let all the messengers of God worship him.’ 
1:7 And indeed toward the messengers he says, ‘Who makes* his messengers<i>,</i> spirits, and his ministers*, a flame of fire.’ 
1:8 But <i>he says</i> of the Son<i>,</i> ‘Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom. 
1:9 You have loved* righteousness and hated lawlessness. Because of this, God, your God, has anointed you <i>with the</i> oil of gladness above your companions.’ {Psa 45:6, 7} 
1:10 And, ‘You, Lord, in the beginning founded the earth and the heavens are the works of your hands: 
1:11 they will perish, but you are remaining and they will all become-obsolete like a garment; 
1:12 and you will coil them up like an <i>outer</i> dressing and they will be changed, but you are the same and your years will not fail.’ {Psa 102:25} 
1:13 But to which of the messengers has he previously said, ‘Sit at my right <i>hand</i>, until I should place your enemies <i>as the</i> footstool of your feet? {Psa 110:1}</p>
<p>1:14 Are they not all ministering* spirits, sent forth into service because of those who are about to inherit salvation?</p>
<h3>Hebrews 2</h3>
<p>2:1 Because of this, we ought to take-heed even-more to the things which were heard, lest we might drift away. 
2:2 For* if the word spoken through <i>the</i> messengers became steadfast and every transgression and disobedience* received a just reward; 
2:3 how shall we flee away from <i>him</i>, if we neglect so-great a salvation, having received <i>it in the</i> beginning <i>when</i> spoken through the Lord, which was confirmed to us by those who heard <i>it</i>? 
2:4 God <i>was</i> testifying together with them, both by signs and by wonders and by various powers and by distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>2:5 For* he did not subject the future inhabited-earth to messengers, <i>about</i> which we are speaking. 
2:6 But a certain <i>writer</i> has thoroughly testified somewhere, saying, ‘What is man, that you remember him? Or the son of man, that you visit him? 
2:7 You made him a bit <i>of</i> something inferior <i>less</i> than the messengers. You crowned him with glory and honor. {T} <i>And stood him over the works of your hands.</i> 
2:8 You subjected all things underneath his feet.’ {Psa 8:4-6} For* in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing <i>which is</i> not subject to him. But we now do not yet see all things having been subjected to him. 
2:9 But we see Jesus who has been made a bit of something inferior, <i>less</i> than <i>the</i> messengers, having been crowned with glory and honor, because of the suffering of the death <i>he underwent</i>,*that by the grace of God he should taste of death on behalf of everyone. 
2:10 For* it was suitable for him, because whom <i>are</i> all things and through whom <i>are</i> all things, having led many sons to glory, to complete the author of their salvation through sufferings. 
2:11 For* both he who is sanctifying and those who are sanctified are all from one. Because of which cause, he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 
2:12 saying, ‘I will proclaim your name to my brethren, in the midst of the congregation* I will sing hymns to you.’ {Psa 22:22} 
2:13 And again, ‘I will have confidence in him.’ And again, ‘Behold, <i>here</i> I <i>am</i> and the children whom God has given me.’{Psa 18:2, 2Sam. 22. 3, Isa 8:17, Isa 8:18} 
2:14 Therefore since the children have shared in flesh and blood, in like-manner he partook of the same; in order that through death, he might do-away-with the one who had the dominion of death, that is, the Devil; 
2:15 and he might set-free those, as many as <i>were</i> in fear of death, <i>who were</i> liable to bondage throughout all their life. 
2:16 For* surely he does not help messengers, but he helps the seed of Abraham. 
2:17 Hence he was obligated to have been similar to his brethren according to all things, that* he might become a merciful and faithful high-priest in things pertaining to God, *that* he should make atonement for the sins of the people. 
2:18 For* in that he himself has suffered, having been tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</p>
<h3>Hebrews 3</h3>
<p>3:1 Hence, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus Christ, the Apostle and High-Priest of our confession; 
3:2 who was faithful to him who made* him <i>such</i>, as Moses also <i>was</i> in his whole house. 
3:3 For* he has been deemed worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as the one who constructed <i>the house</i> has more honor <i>than</i> the house. 
3:4 For* every house is constructed by someone, but the one who constructed all things is God. 
3:5 And Moses indeed was faithful in his whole house as a bondservant, *for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken <i>later</i>; 
3:6 but Christ <i>was faithful</i> as a son, over his house; whose house we are, if indeed* we hold-onto our boldness and the boasting of our hope steadfast till the end. 
3:7 Hence, as the Holy Spirit says, <b>‘Today if you* hear his voice,</b> 
3:8 <b>do not harden your* hearts, as in the rebellion, in the day of the testing in the wilderness,</b> 
3:9 <b>where your* fathers tested me, <i>having</i> proved me<i>,</i> and saw my works forty years.</b> 
3:10 <b>Hence I was displeased with that generation and said, They are habitually misled in their heart<i>s</i>, but they did not know my ways.</b> 
3:11 <b>As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest.’</b> {Num. 14:22, Psa 95:7-11} 
3:12 Beware brethren, lest there will be an evil heart of unbelief in anyone of you*, in withdrawing from the living God. 
3:13 But encourage one another daily, up to what is called today; in order that not anyone of you* may be hardened by the deception of sin. 
3:14 For* we have become companions of Christ, if indeed* we hold-onto the beginning of our firmness steadfast till the end; 
3:15 while* it is said, ‘If you* hear his voice today, do not harden your* hearts, as in the rebellion.’ {Num. 14:29} 
3:16 For* some who <i>had</i> heard <i>it</i> rebelled. But was it not all those who came out of Egypt through Moses? 
3:17 And with whom was he displeased <i>for</i> forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? 
3:18 Now to whom did he swear <i>that</i> they might not enter into his rest, except to the disobedient? 
3:19 And we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.</p>
<h3>Hebrews 4</h3>
<p>4:1 Therefore, since a promise was left of entering into his rest, let us fear lest anyone out of you* seem to have come-short of it. 
4:2 For* indeed we have had the good-news proclaimed to us, just-as they also <i>had</i>. But the word of hearing did not profit them, <i>because</i> it had not been mixed together with those who heard <i>it</i> in the faith. 
4:3 For* we who have believed are entering into that rest; just-as he has said, ‘<b>As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest,</b>’ although the works have happened from the conception of the world. {Psa 95:7:11, Num. 14:22} 
4:4 For* he has thus spoken somewhere concerning the seventh <i>day</i>, ‘And God rested on the seventh day from all his works’; {Gen. 2:2} 
4:5 and in this <i>passage</i> again, ‘They will not enter into my rest.’ {Psa 95:11} 
4:6 Therefore, since it is left <i>for</i> some to enter into it, and those to whom the good-news was proclaimed beforehand did not enter into <i>it</i> because of disobedience, 
4:7 he again determines a certain day as today, saying in David, after so-much time, (just-as it has been said <i>beforehand</i>), ‘Today if you* hear his voice, do not harden your* hearts.’ {Psa 95:7, 8} 
4:8 For* if Joshua had given-rest to them, he would have not been speaking concerning another day after these things. 
4:9 Consequently*, a Sabbath-rest is left for the people of God. 
4:10 For* the one who entered into his rest has also rested from his works, just-as God did from his. 
4:11 Therefore let us be diligent to enter into that rest, in order that not anyone might fall into the same example of disobedience.</p>
<p>4:12 For* the word of God is living and effective and sharper beyond <i>that of</i> any two edged sword and <i>is</i> penetrating <i>even</i> to the division of both soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow and is a judge of the contemplations and deliberations of the heart. 
4:13 And there is no created thing unapparent in his sight, but all things are naked and have been laid-bare to the eyes of him to whom <i>we will give</i> our account.</p>
<br>
<p>4:14 Therefore having a great high-priest, Jesus the Son of God, who has gone through the heavens, let us hold-fast our confession. 
4:15 For* we do not have a high-priest who is unable to sympathize together with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted according to all things according to <i>our</i> likeness, <i>yet</i> without sin. 
4:16 Therefore let us come to the throne of the grace with boldness, in order that we may receive mercy and may find grace *for opportune help.</p>
<h3>Hebrews 5</h3>
<p>5:1 For* every high-priest, being taken from <i>among</i> men, is designated <i>to act</i> on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, that* he may offer both gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins; 
5:2 he who is able to moderate his emotions with those who are ignorant and are misled, since he himself is also encompassed <i>with</i> weakness; 
5:3 and because of this <i>weakness,</i> he is obligated to offer <i>sacrifices</i> on behalf of sins concerning the people so also concerning himself. 
5:4 And not anyone take the honor for himself, but he who is called by God, just-as <i>was</i> Aaron. 
5:5 So Christ also did not glorify himself to become a high-priest, but he who spoke to him, ‘You are my Son; I have fathered you* today.’ {Psa 2:7} 
5:6 Just-as he also says in a different <i>Scripture,</i> ‘You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.’ {Psa 110:4} 
5:7 <i>It is he</i> who in the days of his flesh, has offered up both prayers and supplications with a strong outcry and tears to him who was able to save him from death and having been heard for his piety. 
5:8 Although being a Son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered; 
5:9 and having been completed, he became the cause of everlasting salvation to all those who are obeying* him; 
5:10 having been addressed by God, <i>as</i> high-priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<br>
<p>5:11 Concerning whom we have many things to say and it is hard to clarify, since you* have become sluggish in hearing. 
5:12 For* <i>indeed</i>, because of the time, you* ought to be teachers <i>by now, but</i> you* again have need <i>of one</i> to teach you* what <i>are</i> the fundamental principles of the beginning oracles of God, and have become <i>ones</i> having need of milk and not of solid nourishment. 
5:13 For* everyone who partakes of milk <i>is</i> inexperienced from the word of righteousness; for* he is an infant. 
5:14 But solid nourishment is for <i>the</i> mature <i>ones</i>, those who have their senses exercised to the discerning of both good and evil because of habit.</p>
<h3>Hebrews 6</h3>
<p>6:1 Hence, having left the word of the beginning <i>principles</i> of Christ, we should carry <i>onward</i> to maturity; not putting down again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith upon God, 
6:2 of the teaching of immersions* {Or: <i>O.T.</i> ceremonial  washings} and of <i>the</i> laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of everlasting judgment. 
6:3 And we might do this, if indeed* God permits. 
6:4 For* <i>it is</i> impossible, those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and had become partakers of the Holy Spirit 
6:5 and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the future world 
6:6 and <i>then</i> fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, <i>because they are</i> again crucifying for themselves the Son of God and disgracing <i>him</i>. 
6:7 For* the soil, which has drunk the rainfall, when* it has come often upon it, and is bearing <i>forth</i> vegetation fit for those because of whom it is also cultivated, receives blessing from God. 
6:8 But when* it is bringing forth thorns and thistles, <i>it is</i> unapproved and near to a curse; whose end is *for burning.</p>
<br>
<p>6:9 But, beloved, we have confidence <i>of</i> the better things concerning you* and <i>better things</i> holding to salvation, even if we speak so. 
6:10 For* God is not unrighteous to forget your* work and the labor of the love* which you* showed toward his name, in that you* served the holy-ones and <i>still are</i> serving <i>them</i>. 
6:11 But we are desiring each of you* to show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope <i>even</i> to the end; 
6:12 that* you* should not become sluggish, but imitators of those who are inheriting the promises through faith and patience.</p>
<br>
<p>6:13 For* when* God promised to Abraham, since he was holding no one greater to swear according to <i>them</i>, he swore according to himself, 
6:14 saying, Absolutely <i>in</i> blessing, I will bless you and multiplying, I will multiply you. {Gen. 22:17} 
6:15 And thus <i>Abraham</i>, having <i>had</i> patience, obtained the promise. 
6:16 For* indeed, men swear according to the greater and the oath <i>made</i> *for confirmation <i>is</i> an end in every dispute of theirs. 
6:17 In which God, planning to show even-more to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable <i>will</i> of his counsel, intermediated <i>this</i> with an oath; 
6:18 that* through two unchangeable matters, in which <i>it is</i> impossible <i>for</i> God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge, to take-hold of the hope that lays before us. 
6:19 <i>This hope</i> which we have as an anchor of the soul, <i>is</i> both secure and steadfast and entering into the inner <i>side</i> of the curtain; 
6:20 where a forerunner Jesus entered on our behalf, having become a high-priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<h3>Hebrews 7</h3>
<p>7:1 For* this Melchizedek, King of Salem, priest of the Highest God, who met Abraham returning from the butcher of the kings and blessed him, 
7:2 to whom Abraham also divided a tenth of all. Being first, by translation, King of righteousness and thereafter also King of Salem, which is King of peace; 
7:3 <i>he had</i> no father, no mother, with no genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but having been made similar to the Son of God, remains a continual priest.</p>
<br>
<p>7:4 Now view how-great this <i>man was</i>, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the spoils. 
7:5 And they indeed from the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have <i>the</i> commandment to take-tithes from the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, although these have come out of the loins of Abraham. 
7:6 But he whose genealogy is not traced from them has taken-tithes of Abraham and has blessed him who has the promises. 
7:7 But without any dispute the inferior is blessed by the better. 
7:8 And men indeed receive tithes <i>who</i> die here, but there, it is testified that he is living. 
7:9 And, <i>so</i> as to speak <i>the</i> saying, even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid-tithes through Abraham; 
7:10 for* he was still in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.</p>
<br>
<p>{NOTES: At the Lord’s Supper and in Hebrews at 
7:22 and throughout the rest of the Bible: the English words, ‘covenant’ and ‘testament’ used by various translations have always been the same Greek word. The Old or New Testament is exactly the same as The Old or New Covenant. Covenant was adapted throughout the MLV because it also has a verb form. More is in the ‘Definitions’ section.}</p>
<br>
<p>7:11 Therefore, if there indeed was completion through the Levitical priesthood (for* the people had <i>the</i> law instituted upon it), what need <i>was there</i> still <i>for</i> another priest to rise up according to the order of Melchizedek and not to be called* according to the order of Aaron? 
7:12 For* when* the priesthood is transferred, there also becomes, out of necessity, a transfer of the law. 
7:13 For* he belongs to different tribe of whom these things are said, from which no one has taken-heed at the altar. 
7:14 For* it is evident that our Lord has risen up out of Judah; <i>as</i> to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning the priesthood. 
7:15 And <i>what we say</i> is still even-more evident, if there stands up a different priest, according to the likeness of Melchizedek, 
7:16 who has become, not according to the Law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an indestructible life; 
7:17 for* he testifies<i>,</i> ‘You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.’ {Psa 110:4} 
7:18 For* indeed, there becomes a nullifying of the preceding commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness 
7:19 (for the law completed nothing) and a bringing* in of a better hope, through which we are drawing near to God. 
7:20 And inasmuch as <i>it is</i> not without the taking of an oath for they indeed have become priests without an oath, 
7:21 but he with an oath through him who says pertaining to him, ‘<i>The</i> Lord swore and will not regret, you are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.’ {Psa 110:4} 
7:22 According to so-much <i>more</i>, Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant*. 
7:23 And they have become indeed many priests <i>in number</i>, because they are prevented by death to remain <i>in office</i>; 
7:24 but because he remains forever, he has his perpetual priesthood. 
7:25 Hence he is also able to completely save those who come to God through him, always living, *that* he may intercede on their behalf.</p>
<br>
<p>7:26 For* such a high-priest is suitable for us, holy, guiltless, undefiled, has been separated from sinners and became exalted from the heavens; 
7:27 who has no daily necessity to offer up sacrifices just-like the high-priests, (beforehand on behalf of their own sins), and thereafter for* those of the people; for* he did this once for all, having offered up himself. 
7:28 For* the law designates men <i>as</i> high-priests, <i>who</i> have weakness, but the word of the oath, which was after the law, <i>appoints</i> a Son, having been completed forever.</p>
<h3>Hebrews 8</h3>
<p>8:1 Now a summation on the things which we are saying <i>is this</i>: we have such a high-priest, who sat down at <i>the</i> right <i>hand</i> of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, 
8:2 a minister* of the holy-places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not man. 
8:3 For* every high-priest is designated, *that* he should offer both gifts and sacrifices; hence <i>it is</i> necessary <i>for</i> this one to also have something that he should offer. 
8:4 Now if he indeed was upon <i>the</i> earth, he would not even be a priest, seeing there are the priests who offer the gifts according to the law; 
8:5 who gives-divine service to <i>what is</i> a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just-as Moses had been divinely-warned when* he was about to complete the tabernacle; for* he says, You will make* all things according to the pattern which was shown to you in the mountain. {Ex 25:40} 
8:6 But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry*, inasmuch as he is also the intermediary of a better covenant*, which has been instituted upon better promises.</p>
<p>8:7 For* if that first <i>covenant</i>* had been blameless, then no place would have been sought for a second. 
8:8 For* finding-fault with them, he says, ‘Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, That I will complete a new covenant* upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah; 
8:9 not according to the covenant* that I made* with their fathers in the day that I took <i>them</i> by their hand to lead them forth out of <i>the</i> land of Egypt, because they did not remain in my covenant* and I neglected them, says <i>the</i> Lord. 
8:10 Because this <i>is</i> the covenant* that I will covenant* with the house of Israel after those days, says <i>the</i> Lord. I <i>will</i> give my laws into their mind and I will also write them upon their hearts. And I will be a God to them and they will be <i>covenanted</i> into a people for me; 
8:11 and they may never* <i>need to</i> teach, saying, Know the Lord; <i>to</i> each <i>one</i> his fellow-citizen and each <i>one</i> his brother, because all will know me, from the little to the great of them. 
8:12 Because I will be lenient to their unrighteousness; I may never* remember their lawlessness and their sins anymore.’ {Jer. 31:31-34}</p>
<p>8:13 In the saying, a new <i>covenant</i>*, the first has become-obsolete. But what becomes-obsolete and is aged, it is near to disappearing.</p>
<h3>Hebrews 9</h3>
<p>9:1 Then* indeed even <i>the</i> first <i>tabernacle</i> had ordinances of divine service <i>to God</i> and its holy-place, a worldly <i>one</i>. 
9:2 For* the first tabernacle was prepared, which is called* holy, in which <i>were</i> the lamp-stand and the table and the showbread. 
9:3 But, the tabernacle which is called the holy of holies <i>was</i> after the second curtain; 
9:4 holding a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant*, having been covered <i>all</i> around on every-side with gold, in which <i>was the</i> golden jar holding the manna and Aaron’s scepter which <i>had</i> sprouted and the tablets of the covenant*; 
9:5 and up above it <i>the</i> cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; concerning which things it is now not <i>the time</i> to speak <i>of them</i> individually.</p>
<p>9:6 Now these things having thus always been prepared, the priests indeed go into the first tabernacle, completing the divine services <i>to God</i>; 
9:7 but the high-priest <i>went</i> alone into the second, once in the year for all, not without blood, which he offers on behalf of himself and <i>on behalf of</i> the sins of ignorance of the people. 
9:8 The Holy Spirit indicating this, that the way into the holy-places has still not been manifested, while the first tabernacle still has a standing. 
9:9 <i>This tabernacle,</i> (which <i>is</i> a figure toward the present time); according to which are offered both gifts and sacrifices, is not able to complete he who is giving-divine service to <i>God</i> according to the conscience, 
9:10 <i>being</i> only fleshly ordinances, (upon <i>the basis of</i> foods, drinks and assorted ceremonial washings), laid upon us till a time of reformation.</p>
<br>
<p>9:11 But Christ having come <i>as</i> a high-priest of the future good things, through the greater and more complete tabernacle, not made* with hands, that is, not of this creation, 
9:12 nor through the blood of male-goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy-place, having found everlasting redemption. 
9:13 For* if the blood of male-goats and oxen and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling those who have been desecrated, sanctify for the cleanness of the flesh; 
9:14 how much more the blood of Christ, (who through the everlasting Spirit offered himself unblemished to God), will cleanse your* conscience from dead works, *that* you may give-divine service to the living God.</p>
<p>9:15 And because of this, he is the intermediary of a new covenant*, <i>his</i> death having happened *for the redemption of the transgressions that were against the first covenant*, *that those who have been called may receive the promise of the everlasting inheritance. 
9:16 For* where <i>there is</i> a covenant*, <i>it is</i> a necessity <i>for</i> the death of him who covenanted <i>it</i> to be brought <i>about</i>. 
9:17 For* a covenant* is steadfast upon death; since it is never* in power when he who covenanted <i>it</i> is living. 
9:18 Hence even the first <i>covenant</i>* has not been inaugurated without blood. 
9:19 For* when* every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to <i>the</i> law, <i>and</i> when* he took the blood of the calves and the male-goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, 
9:20 saying, ‘This is the blood of the covenant* which God commanded toward you*.’ {Ex. 24:8} 
9:21 Now likewise, he also sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry* in the blood. 
9:22 And according to the law, I may say, almost all things are cleansed in blood and no forgiveness happens without the shedding of blood.</p>
<br>
<p>9:23 Therefore indeed, it was a necessity that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 
9:24 For* Christ did not enter into a holy-place made* with hands, counterparts to the true <i>one</i>, but into heaven itself, now to be manifested before the face of God on our behalf. 
9:25 Nor <i>did he enter</i> that* he should offer himself often, just-like the high-priest enters into the holy-place yearly with* another’s blood; 
9:26 since it was often essential <i>for</i> him to suffer from the conception of the world, but now once for all upon the end of the ages, he has been manifested *for the nullifying of sin through the sacrifice of himself. 
9:27 And inasmuch as it is laid up for men to die once but after this <i>is the</i> judgment; 
9:28 so the Christ, (having been offered once for all, *that* he should carry the sins of many), will also appear a second-time *for salvation, separate from sin, to those who wait for him.</p>
<h3>Hebrews 10</h3>
<p>10:1 For* the law, having a shadow of the future good things, (not the same image of the matters), they are never* able to complete those who come near with the same continual sacrifices which they are offering yearly. 
10:2 Otherwise, <i>why</i> would they not have ceased being offered? Because those who are giving-divine service to <i>God</i>, once having been cleansed, <i>would then</i> have a sinful conscience no more. 
10:3 But in those <i>sacrifices</i> there is a remembrance of sins yearly. 
10:4 For* <i>it is</i> impossible that the blood of oxen and male-goats should take away sins. 
10:5 Hence when* he comes into the world, he says, ‘You did not wish <i>to have</i> sacrifice and offering, but you, yourself, completed a body for me. 
10:6 You were not delighted in whole burnt-offerings and <i>sacrifices</i> concerning sin. 
10:7 Then I said, (as it has been written concerning me in the volume of the book), Behold, I come to do your will, O God.’ {Psa 40:6-8} 
10:8 <i>After</i> saying <i>this</i> above, You do not wish, nor were delighted in sacrifice and offering and whole burnt-offerings and <i>sacrifices</i> concerning sin, (which are offered according to the law), 
10:9 then he has said, ‘Behold, I come to do your will, O God.’ {Psa 40:6-8} He abolishes {Or: takes away <i>permanently</i>. Or: assassinates.} the first <i>covenant</i>*, in order that he should establish the second <i>covenant</i>*, 
10:10 in this will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. 
10:11 And indeed every priest stands daily ministering* and often offering the same sacrifices, which are never* able to take away sins. 
10:12 But having offered one continual sacrifice on behalf of sins, he sat down at <i>the</i> right <i>hand</i> of God; 
10:13 furthermore waiting until his enemies should be placed <i>under the</i> footstool of his feet. 
10:14 For* he has completed the sanctified in one continual offering. 
10:15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for* after he has said, 
10:16 ‘This <i>is</i> the covenant* that I will covenant* *for them after those days, says the Lord, I will give my laws upon their heart and I will also write them upon their minds.’ 
10:17 And ‘I may never* remember their sins and their lawlessness anymore.’ {Jer. 31:33-34} 
10:18 Now where <i>the</i> forgiveness of these <i>is</i>, there is no more an offering concerning sin.</p>
<br>
<p>10:19 Therefore brethren, having boldness *for the entrance <i>into</i> the holy-places by the blood of Jesus, 
10:20 a way which he inaugurated for us, a fresh and living <i>way</i>, through the curtain, that is, his flesh; 
10:21 and <i>having</i> a great priest over the house of God; 
10:22 let us come near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having our body bathed in purest water. 
10:23 We should hold-onto the confession of our hope– unwavering; for* he who promised <i>is</i> faithful. 
10:24 And we should consider one another *for motivating <i>each other</i> to love* and to good works; 
10:25 not forsaking our own gathering together, just-as <i>the</i> custom <i>is</i> with some, but encouraging <i>one another</i>, and so-much more, inasmuch as you* are seeing the day drawing near.</p>
<br>
<p>10:26 For* <i>when</i> we sin willfully after the receiving <i>of</i> the full knowledge of the truth, <i>then</i> a sacrifice is left no more <i>for us</i> concerning sins, 
10:27 but a certain fearful expectancy of judgment and a zeal of fire which is about to devour the adversaries. 
10:28 Anyone who has rejected <i>the</i> Law of Moses, dies without mercy upon <i>the word of</i> two or three witnesses. {Deu 17:6} 
10:29 How much worse punishment, do you* think he will be deemed worthy of, who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has deemed the blood of the covenant* in which he was sanctified <i>as</i> common, and has insulted the Spirit of the grace? 
10:30 For* we know him who said, ‘Vengeance <i>is</i> for me. I will repay says <i>the</i> Lord.’ And again, ‘<i>The</i> Lord will judge his people.’ {Deu. 32:35-36, Psa 135:14} 
10:31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
<br>
<p>10:32 But remind <i>yourselves</i> of the former days, when* you* were enlightened, in which you* endured a large conflict of sufferings; 
10:33 <i>in</i> this indeed, you* were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions, but <i>in</i> this too, you became partners of those who conducted themselves so. 
10:34 For* you* also sympathized together with <i>me</i> in my bonds, and you* accepted the plunder of your* possessions with joy, knowing that you* have for yourselves a better possession in the heavens and an abiding <i>one</i>. 
10:35 Therefore do not cast away your* boldness, which has great reward. 
10:36 For* you* have need of endurance, that*, having done the will of God, you* may get the promise. 
10:37 ‘For* yet a little <i>while</i>, <i>O</i> how-much? <i>O</i> how-much? He who is coming will come and will not delay. 
10:38 But my righteous one will live from faith and if he retreats back, my soul does not delight in him.’ {Isa 26:20, Hab. 2:3-4} 
10:39 But we are not from this retreating back <i>leading</i> to destruction, but <i>we are</i> from <i>the</i> faith <i>leading</i> to the preservation of the soul.</p>
<h3>Hebrews 11</h3>
<p>11:1 Now faith is <i>the</i> essence of <i>things</i> hoped for, a conviction of matters not seen. 
11:2 For* the elders were witnessed in this; 
11:3 in faith, we perceive that the ages have been framed by the declaration of God, toward the things seen, not having become from <i>things</i> which appear. 
11:4 In faith, Abel offered a more <i>excellent</i> sacrifice to God than Cain, through which he was witnessed to be righteous, God testifying on <i>the basis of</i> his gifts and through it he still speaks, <i>although</i> being dead. 
11:5 In faith, Enoch was transferred, not to see death, and he was not <i>to be</i> found, because God transferred him; for* it had been testified <i>of him</i> to have been well pleasing to God before his transfer. 
11:6 But without faith <i>it is</i> impossible to be well pleasing <i>to God</i>; for* it is essential <i>for</i> the one who comes to God to believe that he is and <i>that</i> he becomes a rewarder to those who are seeking him out. 
11:7 In faith, Noah, having been divinely-warned concerning things not yet seen, and being scared, prepared an ark *for the salvation of his house; through which he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith. 
11:8 In faith, Abraham obeyed*, being called to go out to the place which he was about to receive *for an inheritance, and he went out, not knowing where he was going. 
11:9 In faith, he sojourned in the land of promise, as an alien, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the joint heirs of the same promise. 
11:10 For* he was waiting for the city which has the foundations, whose craftsman and contractor is God. 
11:11 In faith, even Sarah herself received power to conceive seed and bore <i>a son</i> beyond <i>the</i> time of <i>her fertile</i> age*, since she deemed him faithful who had promised. 
11:12 And hence from one sterile <i>man</i>, these were born <i>descendants</i> just-as the stars of heaven in a multitude and <i>as</i> innumerable as the sand beside the sea shore<i>.</i></p>
<br>
<p>11:13 These all died according to faith, not having received the promises, but having seen <i>them</i> and having greeted them from farther out and having confessed that they were strangers and travelers upon the earth. 
11:14 For* those who are saying such things disclose that they are seeking after a fatherland of their own. 
11:15 And if they were indeed remembering that <i>region</i> from which they went out, they would have had an opportunity to revisit. 
11:16 But now they are aspiring for a better <i>region</i>, that is, a heavenly one. Hence God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for* he has prepared a city for them.</p>
<br>
<p>11:17 In faith, Abraham, being tested, has offered up Isaac. And he who had accepted the promises was offering up his only begotten <i>son</i>; 
11:18 even he to whom it was said, In Isaac your seed will be called. {Gen. 21:12} 
11:19 Reasoning that God <i>is</i> able to raise even <i>him up</i> from the dead; from where he did also get him back in a figure. 
11:20 In faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, concerning future things. 
11:21 In faith, Jacob, <i>while</i> dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, <i>resting</i> upon the tip of his staff. 
11:22 In faith, Joseph, <i>while</i> dying, made a remembrance concerning the exodus of the sons of Israel, and commanded <i>them</i> concerning his bones.</p>
<p>11:23 In faith, Moses, having been born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a handsome child, and they were not afraid of the king’s command. 
11:24 In faith, Moses, having become great, denied to be called* the son of Pharaoh’s daughter; 
11:25 having selected <i>for himself</i> to be mistreated together with the people of God rather <i>than</i> to have temporary enjoyment of sin. 
11:26 <i>He was</i> deeming the reproach of Christ greater riches <i>than</i> the treasures of Egypt; for* he was looking toward the reward. 
11:27 In faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the fury of the king; for* he persevered, as seeing him who is invisible. 
11:28 In faith, he has made* the Passover and the splashing of the blood <i>on the door frames</i>, in order that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them. 
11:29 In faith, they crossed over the Red Sea as <i>if</i> through dry <i>land</i>; from which the Egyptians having taken an attempt <i>at it</i>, were swallowed up.</p>
<p>11:30 In faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, having been surrounded for seven days. 
11:31 In faith, Rahab the prostitute did not perish together with the disobedient, having accepted the spies with peace.</p>
<br>
<p>11:32 And what more should I say? For* the time will fail me if I describe <i>the things</i> concerning Gideon, Barak, and also Samson and Jephthah; both David and Samuel, and the prophets: 
11:33 who through faith conquered kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, sealed the mouths of lions, 
11:34 quenched the power of fire, fled <i>from</i> the edge of the sword, were empowered from weakness, became mighty in war, the encampments of aliens bowed <i>down</i>. 
11:35 Women received <i>back</i> their dead from a resurrection. But others were tortured, not having accepted their redemption; that* they might obtain a better resurrection, 
11:36 and others received a trial from mocking and scourges, but <i>even</i> more, from bonds and prison: 
11:37 they were stoned, they were sawed <i>in two</i>, they were tempted; <i>they died</i> in murder from the sword; they went around in sheepskins, in goat hides; <i>they were</i> lacking, being afflicted, <i>and</i> being mistreated, 
11:38 (of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in <i>the</i> wildernesses and mountains and caves and the holes of the earth. 
11:39 And all these, having been testified of through the faith {Or: witnessed to through <i>their</i> faith.}, did not get the promise, 
11:40 God having foreseen something better concerning us, that* they should not be completed separate from us.</p>
<br>
<h3>Hebrews 12</h3>
<p>12:1 Therefore, <i>since</i> we also have so-great a cloud of witnesses encompassing us, let us place away from ourselves every interference, and the {F} easily restricting sin, and run through endurance the contest laying before us. 
12:2 Looking away from <i>things, look</i> toward Jesus, the author and completer of the faith, who endured the cross in exchange-for the joy laying before him, having despised shame, and has sat down at the right <i>hand</i> of the throne of God. 
12:3 For* study him who has endured such dispute by sinners to himself, that* you* might not be weary, fainting in your* souls. 
12:4 You* have not yet stood against <i>this,</i> as far as blood, <i>in your</i> struggle against sin. 
12:5 And you* have forgotten the encouragement which reasons with you* as with sons, ‘My son, do not regard-lightly the disciplining of the Lord, nor faint when* you are reproved by him; 
12:6 For* whom the Lord loves*, he disciplines, and scourges every son whom he is accepting.’ {Prov. 3:11-12, Job 5:17} 
12:7 <i>It is</i> *for disciplining <i>that</i> you* endure; God is dealing with you* as with sons; for* what is <i>the</i> son whom <i>his</i> father does not discipline? 
12:8 But if you* are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, consequently*, you* are illegitimate and not sons. 
12:9 Thereafter, we have indeed had the fathers of our flesh <i>as</i> a correctors <i>of us</i>, and we were revering <i>them</i>. Will we not much rather be made subject to the Father of spirits and live? 
12:10 For* they indeed were disciplining <i>us</i> *for a few days according to what <i>did</i> seem <i>right</i> to them, but <i>he does it</i> upon what is advantageous for <i>us</i>, *that* we may receive of his holiness. 
12:11 Now indeed all disciplining does not seem to be <i>a thing</i> of joy for the present*, but of sorrow; yet later it gives peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised because of it. 
12:12 Hence straighten the drooping hands and the paralyzed knees; 
12:13 and make* straightened tracks for your* feet, that* what is lame may not be turned aside, but rather should be healed.</p>
<br>
<p>12:14 Pursue peace with all and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord: 
12:15 exercising the oversight <i>of yourselves</i> lest <i>there is</i> anyone who comes-short, away from the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing upward, might trouble you*, and the many might be defiled through this; 
12:16 lest <i>there is</i> any fornicator or profane <i>person</i>, like Esau, who gave <i>away</i> his birthright in exchange-for one dinner. 
12:17 For* you* know thereafter that even wishing to inherit the bounty, he was rejected*; for* he found no chance for repentance although he sought it with tears.</p>
<br>
<p>12:18 For* you* have not come to a mountain which has been touched and burned with fire and to blackness and to darkness and to whirlwind, 
12:19 and to the noise of a trumpet and to the voice of words; which <i>voice</i> those who heard renounced, <i>asking the</i> word not to be added to them. 
12:20 For* they were carrying <i>out</i> what was ordered, ‘Even if a beast might touch the mountain, it will be stoned.’ {Ex. 19:12-13, 16, Deu. 4:11} 
12:21 And so fearful was the manifestation, <i>that</i> Moses said, ‘I am fearful and trembling. {Deu. 9:19} 
12:22 But you* have come to Mount Zion and to <i>the</i> city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to tens of thousands of messengers, 
12:23 to the festal-gathering and to the {F} congregation* of the firstborn <i>ones</i>, who have been registered in the heavens and to God, the Judge of all, and to <i>the</i> spirits of <i>the</i> righteous who have been completed, 
12:24 and to Jesus the intermediary of a new covenant*, and to the blood of sprinkling which speaks better than <i>that of</i> Abel. 
12:25 Beware <i>that</i> you* do not renounce him who speaks. For* if those <i>men</i> did not flee when* they renounced him who divinely-warned <i>them</i> upon the earth, much more we <i>may not flee</i> who are turning away from him, <i>who is</i> from the heavens; 
12:26 whose voice then shook the earth. But now he has promised, saying, ‘Still once for all, I do not only shake the earth, but also the heaven.’ {Hag. 2:6} 
12:27 And the <i>saying</i>, ‘still once for all,’ indicates the transfer of those things which are shaken, as of things that have been made*, in order that those things <i>which are</i> not shaken may remain. 
12:28 Hence, receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us have grace, through which we give-divine service <i>in ways</i> well pleasing to God, with reverence and piety; 
12:29 for* our God is also a consuming fire.</p>

<h3>Hebrews 13</h3>
<p>13:1 Let brotherly-love abide. 
13:2 Do not forget hospitality; for* through this, some lodged messengers, <i>being</i> eluded. 
13:3 Remember those who are prisoners, as having been bound together with <i>them</i>; those who are mistreated, as <i>though</i> being <i>mistreated</i> yourselves also in the body. 
13:4 <i>Let</i> marriage <i>be</i> honored among all and <i>let</i> the marriage-bed <i>be</i> undefiled, but fornicators and adulterers God will judge. 
13:5 In the manner <i>of life,</i> not <i>being</i> a money-lover, be content with the things that are present*; for* he himself has said, I may never* be lax <i>concerning</i> you, nor should I ever forsake you. 
13:6 So-that we, being courageous, may say, The Lord is my helper and I will not fear. What will man do to me? {Psa 56:4, 11; 118:6}</p>
<br>
<p>13:7 Remember your* leaders, men who spoke to you* the word of God, and review <i>the</i> outcome of <i>their</i> conduct; imitate the faith <i>of such</i>. 
13:8 Jesus Christ <i>is</i> the same yesterday and today, and forever. 
13:9 Do not be carried away by various and strange teachings; for* <i>it is</i> good that the heart be established by grace; not by foods, in which those who walked have not been profited. 
13:10 We have an altar, from which those who give-divine service to the tabernacle have no authority to eat. 
13:11 For* the bodies of those creatures, whose blood is brought into the holy-place through the high-priest <i>as an offering</i> concerning sin, are burned outside the encampment. 
13:12 Hence Jesus also suffered outside the gate, that* he might sanctify the people through his own blood. 
13:13 Now-then let us go forth to him outside the encampment, carrying his reproach. 
13:14 For* we do not have an abiding city here, but we are seeking after the future <i>city.</i> 
13:15 Therefore, let us <i>always</i> offer up a sacrifice of praising through him to God, that is, the fruit of <i>our</i> lips confessing in his name. 
13:16 But do not forget the practice of good* and fellowship; for God is well pleased with such sacrifices. 
13:17 Obey your* leaders and yield yourselves <i>to them</i>; for* they are watching <i>out</i> on behalf of your* souls, as those who will give account; that* they may do this with joy and not groaning; for* this <i>would be</i> detrimental to you*.</p>
<br>
<p>13:18 Pray concerning us; for* we have confidence that we have a good conscience, wishing to conduct ourselves <i>in a</i> good <i>manner</i> in all things. 
13:19 But I am encouraging <i>you</i>* even-more to do this, that* I may be restored to you* shortly.</p>
<br>
<p>13:20 Now the God of peace, who brought* up the great shepherd of the sheep, our Lord Jesus, from the dead by the blood of an everlasting covenant*, 
13:21 may he complete you* in every good work, *that* you* should practice his will, doing what is well pleasing in his sight in you*, through Jesus Christ: to whom <i>is</i> the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>13:22 But I am encouraging you*, brethren, tolerate the word of encouragement, for* I have informed you* by letter through bits <i>of information</i>. 
13:23 Do you* know that <i>our</i> brother Timothy has been released? With whom, I will see you* if he comes shortly.</p>
<br>
<p>13:24 Greet all your* leaders and all the holy-ones. Those from Italy greet you*.</p>
<br>
<p>13:25 Grace <i>be</i> with you* all. Amen.</p>

<h3>James 1</h3>
<p>1:1 James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes, those <i>who are</i> in the dispersion. Hail <i>to you*</i>!</p>
<br>
<p>1:2 My brethren, deem it <i>with</i> all joy, whenever you* fall into various temptations, 
1:3 knowing that the testing of your* faith is working endurance. 
1:4 But let endurance have <i>its</i> complete work, that* you* may be complete and whole, deficient in nothing.</p>
<br>
<p>1:5 But if anyone of you* is deficient of wisdom, let him ask from God, who gives to all liberally and does not reproach <i>any</i>, and it will be given to him. 
1:6 But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing. For* he who is doubting resembles a wave of the sea being blown by the wind and tossed <i>around</i>. 
1:7 For* do not let that man assume that he will receive anything from the Lord– 
1:8 an indecisive man is restless in all his ways.</p>
<br>
<p>1:9 Now let the humble brother boast in his elevation, 
1:10 but the rich <i>brother</i> in his humbleness, because like the flower of the grass, he will pass away. 
1:11 For* the sun has risen together with the burning heat, and dried up the grass, and its flower falls and the beauty of its face perished. So shall the rich man also fade away in his pursuits.</p>
<br>
<p>1:12 The man who is enduring temptation is fortunate, because having become approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to those who love* him. 
1:13 Let no one say when* he is tempted, I am tempted by God, for* God is not temptable from evils, and he himself tempts no one. 
1:14 But each <i>person</i> is tempted, when* he is pulled away and enticed by his own lust. 
1:15 Thereafter when* this lust has conceived, it bears sin, and sin, when* it has matured, gives-birth to death. 
1:16 Do not be misled, my beloved brethren!</p>
<br>
<p>1:17 Every good <i>act of</i> giving, and every complete gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor a shadow of turning. 
1:18 Having willed <i>it</i>, he gave-birth to us by the word of truth, *that* we might be a certain first-fruit of his created things.</p>
<br>
<p>1:19 So-then my beloved brethren, let every man be quick in order to hear, slow in order to speak, <i>and</i> slow to wrath. 
1:20 For* the wrath of man is not working the righteousness of God. 
1:21 Hence, having laid away from yourselves all filthiness and the abundance of malice, accept the implanted word in meekness, which is able to save your* souls.</p>
<p>1:22 But become doers of the word and not hearers only, deluding yourselves. 
1:23 Because if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he resembles a man considering his face <i>(which was his</i> from birth) in a mirror. 
1:24 For* he <i>has</i> considered himself, and has gone away and immediately forgot what sort of man he was. 
1:25 But he who has peered into the complete law, the <i>law</i> of freedom, and has remained <i>in it</i>, this one, having not become a forgetful hearer, but a doer who works, this one will be fortunate in his doing {Or: action}.</p>
<p>1:26 If anyone among you* thinks himself to be religious, <i>though</i> he does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this one’s religion is futile. 
1:27 A clean and undefiled religion with our God and Father is this: to {F} visit {F} the orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.</p>
<br>

<h3>James 2</h3>
<p>2:1 My brethren, do not have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, <i>the Lord</i> of glory, with* partiality. 
2:2 For* if a man comes into your* congregation* <i>with</i> a gold ring, in bright apparel and <i>if</i> a poor man in filthy apparel also comes in, 
2:3 you* may have looked upon him who is wearing the bright apparel and may have said to him, Sit here; good; and you* may have said to the poor <i>person</i>, Stand there or sit here under my footstool. 
2:4 And did you* not discern among yourselves and <i>then</i> became judges from evil reasonings?</p>
<p>2:5 Listen, my beloved brethren. Did God not choose the poor of the world <i>to be</i> rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to those who love* him? 
2:6 But you* have dishonored the poor. Are the rich not oppressing you*? And are they <i>not</i> dragging you* into <i>the</i> courts? 
2:7 Are they not blaspheming the good name, the one which was surnamed upon you*? 
2:8 Nevertheless, if you* complete the royal law, according to the Scripture, ‘You will love* your neighbor like yourself,’ you* are doing well. {Lev. 19:18} 
2:9 But if you* have shown-partiality, you* work sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</p>
<p>2:10 For* who<i>ever</i> will keep the whole law and yet will trip in one <i>point</i>, he has become liable to all <i>of it</i>. 
2:11 For* he who said, 'Do not commit adultery,' also said, 'Do not murder.' {Ex. 20:13-14, Deu. 5:17-18} But if you will not commit adultery, but <i>yet</i> you will <i>commit</i> murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. 
2:12 Speak so and practice so, as men who are about to be judged by <i>the</i> law of freedom. 
2:13 For* judgment <i>is</i> merciless to him who has not practiced mercy; mercy wins over judgment.</p>
<br>
<p>2:14 What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith, but does not have works? Is that faith able to save him? 
2:15 But if a brother or sister is* naked and may be deficient of daily nourishment, 
2:16 and anyone out of you* may say to them, Go in peace. Be warmed and fed, but you* do not give them the body’s requirements; what does it profit? 
2:17 So also <i>your</i> faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself.</p>
<p>2:18 But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith away from your works. I will also show you my faith by my works. 
2:19 You believe that God is one; you are doing well. The demons also believe and shudder. 
2:20 But are you willing to know, O vain man, that faith is dead without works?</p>
<p>2:21 Was not Abraham our father justified from works, having offered up Isaac his son upon the altar? 
2:22 Do you see that faith was working together with his works and <i>his</i> faith was completed from <i>his</i> works? 
2:23 And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, ‘And Abraham believed God and it was counted to him *for righteousness,' and he was called the friend of God. {Gen 15:6} 
2:24 Now-then, do you* see that a man is justified from works and not from faith alone? 
2:25 Now likewise, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified from works, when* she accepted the messengers and sent them out a different way? 
2:26 For* just-as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead.</p>
<h3>James 3</h3>
<p>3:1 My brethren, do not let many <i>of you</i>* become teachers, knowing that we will receive a greater judgment. 
3:2 For*we all trip in many things. If anyone does not trip in speech, this one is a mature man, also able to bridle the whole body. 
3:3 Behold we put the horses’ bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, and we direct their whole body. 
3:4 Behold also the ships, <i>though</i> they are so-great and are driven by hard winds, yet they are directed by a little rudder, wherever the impulse of the steersman is planning.</p>
<p>3:5 So the tongue is also a little member and boasts of magnificent things. Behold, how-vast a forest is lit by <i>such</i> a small fire! 
3:6 And the tongue is a fire, the world of unrighteousness. Thus the tongue is designated among our members <i>as</i> what stains the whole body and ignites the cycle of life {Greek: birth or origin or generations} and is ignited by hell. 
3:7 For* every nature of beasts and birds, of reptiles and sea-creatures, is tamed and has been tamed by human nature. 
3:8 But none of mankind is able to tame the tongue; <i>it is</i> an uncontrollable evil, <i>it is</i> full of deadly poison. 
3:9 We thank God and <i>the</i> Father with* it and we curse men with* it, those who have become according to the likeness of God. 
3:10 Thanks and cursing comes out from the same mouth. My brethren, these things do not need to become so! 
3:11 The spring is not gushing sweet and bitter <i>water</i> from the same hole <i>in the ground, is it</i>? 
3:12 My brethren, a fig tree is not able to produce olives or a vine figs, are they? Thus no spring <i>is able</i> to produce <i>both</i> salty and sweet water.</p>
<br>
<p>3:13 Who is wise and knowledgeable among you*? Let him show out of his good conduct his works in meekness of wisdom. 
3:14 But if you* have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your* heart, do not boast and lie against the truth. 
3:15 This wisdom is not <i>a wisdom</i> that comes down from above, but is earthly, physical, demonic. 
3:16 For* where jealousy and selfish ambition <i>are</i>, there <i>is</i> unrest and every evil matter. 
3:17 But the wisdom <i>which is</i> from above is indeed first pure, thereafter <i>is</i> peaceful, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and non-pretended. 
3:18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who are making* peace.</p>
<h3>James 4</h3>
<p>4:1 From where do <i>the</i> wars and quarrels among you* <i>come from</i>? <i>Is it</i> not from here, from your* own sensual-delights which are warring in your* members? 
4:2 You* lust and do not have; you* murder and are jealous and are not able to obtain; you* quarrel and make war; you* do not have, because you* do not ask. 
4:3 You* ask and do not receive, because you* ask evilly, that* you* may spend <i>it</i> in your* sensual-delights.</p>
<p>4:4 Adulterers and adulteresses, do you* not know that the friendship of the world is enmity <i>with</i> God? Therefore, whoever wills to be a friend of the world is designated <i>as</i> an enemy of God. 
4:5 Or are you* thinking that the Scripture speaks with emptiness? Does the Spirit who dwells in us long to envy? 
4:6 But he is giving greater grace. Hence <i>the Scripture</i> says, ‘God resists the haughty, but gives grace to the humble.’ {Prov 3:34}</p>
<p>4:7 Therefore, be subject to God and stand against the Devil, and he will flee from you*. 
4:8 Draw near to God and he will draw near to you*. Cleanse <i>your*</i> hands sinners and purify <i>your*</i> hearts <i>you*</i> indecisive! 
4:9 Be miserable and mourn and weep. Let your* laughter be turned to mourning and your* joy to gloom. 
4:10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he will exalt you*.</p>
<br>
<p>4:11 Brethren do not speak against one another. He who is speaking against a brother and is judging his brother, is speaking against the law and is judging the law. Now if you are judging the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge. 
4:12 There is the one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy; who are you who judges the other?</p>
<br>
<p>4:13 Come now, you* who are saying, Today and the next-day, we should travel into this city and spend one year there and be a merchant and make* a gain. 
4:14 You* do not know what the next-day <i>will bring</i>, for* what <i>is</i> your* life? For* it will be a vapor, which appears for a few but thereafter disappears. 
4:15 Instead of that, you* should say, If the Lord wills, and we should also live, <i>then</i> we may do this or that. 
4:16 But now you* boast in your* egotism. All such boasting is evil. 
4:17 Therefore knowing to do good and not doing <i>it</i>, to him, it is sin.</p>
<h3>James 5</h3>
<p>5:1 Come now <i>you*</i> rich, weep, howling in your* miseries, which are coming upon <i>you</i>*. 
5:2 Your* riches have rotted and your* garments have become moth-eaten. 
5:3 Your* gold and silver have tarnished, and their tarnish will be *for a testimony <i>against</i> you* and will eat your* flesh like fire. You* <i>have</i> stored up <i>treasure</i> in <i>the</i> last days. 
5:4 Behold, the wages of the workers who mowed your* farmlands, <i>these wages</i> which have been defrauded by you*, are crying out <i>against you</i>* and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Hosts. 
5:5 You* have caroused upon the land and are self-indulgent; you* have nourished your* hearts as in a day of slaughter. 
5:6 You* have sentenced <i>others</i>, you* have murdered the righteous; he is not resisting you*.</p>
<br>
<p>5:7 Therefore brethren, have patience until the presence of the Lord. Behold, the farmer who is waiting for the precious fruit of the earth, has patience over it, until it should receive <i>the</i> morning and evening rainfall. 
5:8 You* also, have patience; establish your* hearts, because the presence of the Lord has drawn near. 
5:9 Brethren, do not groan against one another, that* you* may not be judged. Behold, the judge stands before the doors.</p>
<p>5:10 Brethren, take <i>as</i> an example of suffering evil treatment and of patience the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. 
5:11 Behold, we esteem those fortunate who are enduring. You* have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the end of the Lord, how that he is very affectionate and compassionate.</p>
<br>
<p>5:12 But before all things my brethren, do not swear, neither <i>by</i> the heaven, nor <i>by</i> the earth, nor <i>by</i> any other oath, but let your* yes be yes and your* no <i>be</i> no; that* you* may not fall into hypocrisy.</p>
<br>
<p>5:13 Is anyone among you* suffering evil treatment? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing-praise. 
5:14 Is anyone among you* sick? Let him invite the elders of the congregation*, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil in the name of the Lord. 
5:15 And the vow of the faith will save him who is weary and the Lord will lift him up, even if he has been practicing sins, it will be forgiven him.</p>
<p>5:16 Therefore confess your* trespasses to one another, and pray on behalf of one another, *that you* may be healed. The supplication of a righteous man prevails; much <i>in its</i> working. 
5:17 Elijah was a man of like-feelings to us and he prayed with <i>intense</i> prayer that it might not rain, and it did not rain upon the land <i>for</i> three years and six months. 
5:18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rainfall and the land sprouted her fruit.</p>
<br>
<p>5:19 Brethren, if anyone among you* are misled from the truth and someone should return him <i>to it</i>; 
5:20 let him know, that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and will hide a multitude of sins.</p>

<h3>1 Peter 1</h3>
<p>1:1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, <i>to the</i> chosen who are travelers of <i>the</i> dispersion from Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithyna, 
1:2 according to <i>the</i> foreknowledge of God <i>the</i> Father, in <i>the</i> sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of <i>the</i> blood of Jesus Christ: grace to you* and may peace be multiplied.</p>
<br>
<p>1:3 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>is</i> gracious*, who according to his much mercy has born us again to a living hope through <i>the</i> resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
1:4 to an incorruptible, undefiled and unfading inheritance having been guarded in the heavens *for you*; 
1:5 who, in <i>the</i> power of God, are being kept through faith to a salvation ready to be revealed in <i>the</i> last time. 
1:6 In which you* are glad, having been made sorrowful in various tests, it is <i>only</i> now <i>for</i> a few <i>moments;</i> if it is essential 
1:7 that* the trial of your* faith, (<i>being</i> much <i>more</i> precious <i>than</i> gold, which is perishing), <i>even</i> now being tested through fire, may be found *for praise and honor and to glory in <i>the</i> revelation of Jesus Christ. 
1:8 You* love* whom, you* have not seen {Or: known}; now you* believe in whom you* do not see; <i>in both</i> you* are glad with unspeakable and glorified joy; 
1:9 getting <i>to</i> the end of your* faith, <i>that is</i> the salvation of <i>your</i>* souls. 
1:10 Concerning which salvation the prophets, who prophesied concerning the grace that <i>should come</i> to you*, sought out and searched out; 
1:11 searching what <i>time</i> or what <i>sort of</i> time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating, <i>when</i> testifying beforehand <i>of</i> the sufferings of Christ and the glories <i>following</i> after these things. 
1:12 To whom it was revealed, that they were serving the same things not to themselves, but to us; which <i>things</i> now have been reported to you* through those who proclaimed the good-news to you* in the Holy Spirit, when* he was sent forth from heaven; into which things messengers desire to peer <i>into</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>1:13 Hence when* you* have girded up the loins of your* mind, <i>while</i> being sober, hope completely upon the grace being brought to you* at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 
1:14 like children of obedience not fashioning yourselves in your* former lusts in <i>the time of</i> your* ignorance; 
1:15 but according to he who called you*, <i>who is</i> holy, you* yourselves also become holy in all <i>your</i>* conduct; 
1:16 because it has been written, ‘Become holy, because I am holy.’ {Lev. 11:44-45, 19:2, 20:7,26} 
1:17 And if you* call upon the Father, who impartially judges according to the work of each <i>one</i>, conduct yourselves in fear <i>during</i> the time of your* foreign residency <i>here</i>; 
1:18 knowing that you* were not redeemed by corruptible things<i>–</i> by silver or by gold, <i>nor</i> from your* futile conduct handed down from <i>your*</i> forefathers. 
1:19 But as of a lamb unblemished and unstained, <i>you were redeemed</i> by <i>the</i> precious blood of Christ, 
1:20 who indeed, having been known beforehand, before the conception of the world, but has been manifested at <i>the</i> last times because of you*, 
1:21 who believe through him in God. <i>The God</i> who raised him <i>up</i> from the dead and gave him glory; so-that your* faith and hope might be in God. 
1:22 Seeing you* have purified your* souls in your* obedience to the truth through the Spirit toward non-pretended brotherly-love, intensely love* one another from a clean heart; 
1:23 having been born again, not out of corruptible seed, but from <i>the</i> incorruptible, through <i>the</i> word of God, which is living and remaining forever. 
1:24 Because, ‘All flesh <i>is</i> like grass and all the glory of man <i>is</i> like the flower of grass. The grass dried up and the flower of it fell away. 
1:25 But the declaration of the Lord is abiding forever.’ {Isa 40:6-9} And this is the declaration of the good-news which was proclaimed to you*.</p>
<h3>1 Peter 2</h3>
<p>2:1 Therefore having placed away from yourselves all malice and all treachery, and hypocrisies and envies, and all slanders, 
2:2 as newborn babies, long-for the logical milk <i>which has</i> no treachery, that* you* may grow in it; 
2:3 if indeed*, you* have tasted <i>it</i>, that the Lord is kind; 
2:4 coming to him, a living stone, having indeed been rejected* with men, but chosen <i>and</i> precious with God. 
2:5 <i>You*</i>, yourselves, like living stones, are also built up <i>as</i> a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 
2:6 Because it is contained in the Scripture, ‘Behold, I place in Zion, a cornerstone, chosen <i>and</i> precious, and he who believes on him may never* be ashamed.’ {Isa 28:16} 
2:7 Therefore, to you* who believe <i>is</i> the honor, but to <i>the</i> disobedient, ‘<i>The</i> stone which the builders rejected*, this became to <i>them the</i> head of <i>the</i> corner'; {Psa 118:22} 
2:8 and, ‘A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense'; {Isa 8:14} to those who are stumbling in the word, being disobedient; they were also appointed* to this. 
2:9 But you* <i>are</i> a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people *for <i>God’s</i> ownership, *that you* may proclaim the virtues of him who called you* out of darkness into his marvelous light; 
2:10 who previously <i>were</i> not a people, but <i>now are</i> the people of God; who had not been shown-mercy, but now have been shown-mercy.</p>
<br>
<p>2:11 Beloved, I am encouraging you*, as foreigners and travelers, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which are warring against the soul; 
2:12 having your* good conduct <i>seen</i> among the Gentiles; that*, in what they are speaking against you*, as evildoers, they may glorify God in the day of visitation, having eye-witnessed <i>things</i> from <i>your*</i> good works.</p>
<br>
<p>2:13 Therefore be subject to every human creation because of the Lord: whether to the king, as being superior to <i>you</i>*; 
2:14 or to governors, as <i>they are</i> sent through him *for vengeance <i>on</i> evildoers and praise <i>to the</i> doers of good. 
2:15 Because so is the will of God, to hush the ignorance of foolish men <i>by you*</i> doing good; 
2:16 as free and <i>yet</i> not having <i>your*</i> freedom as a covering of malice, but as bondservants of God. 
2:17 Honor all <i>men</i>. Love* the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</p>
<br>
<p>2:18 Domestic <i>servants</i>, be subject to <i>your*</i> masters in all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the crooked. 
2:19 For* this is acceptable, if anyone undergoes sorrows because of <i>his</i> consciousness of God, suffering wrongfully. 
2:20 For* what credit <i>is it</i>, if, when* you* are sinning and are battered <i>for it</i>, you* will endure <i>it</i>? But if, when* you* are doing good and are suffering <i>for it</i>, you* will endure <i>it</i>; this <i>is</i> acceptable with God. 
2:21 For* to this you* were called, because Christ also suffered on our behalf, leaving to you* a model, that* you* should follow in his footprints. 
2:22 <i>He</i> who did no sin, nor was treachery found in his mouth; 
2:23 who, being reviled, was not reviling again <i>in return</i>; <i>when</i> suffering, was not threatening, but was giving <i>himself</i> to him who judges righteously. 
2:24 He, himself, carried our sins in his body upon the tree, that* we might live to righteousness, having died to sins; by whose wound<i>s</i> you* were healed. 
2:25 For* you* were being misled like sheep, but are now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your* souls.</p>
<h3>1 Peter 3</h3>
<p>3:1 Likewise, wives be subject to your* own husbands; that*, even if some are disobedient to the word, they might be gained without the word through the conduct of their wives; 
3:2 having eye-witnessed your* pure conduct in fear; 
3:3 whose adornment, do not let it be the outward <i>adornment</i> of braiding the hair, and of placing on of gold or of clothing of <i>expensive</i>  garments; 
3:4 but <i>let it be</i> the hidden human <i>things</i> of the heart, in the incorruptible <i>clothing</i> of a meek and quiet spirit, which is greatly-valued in God’s sight. 
3:5 For* so, the holy women, those also hoping in God, were previously adorning themselves, being subject to their own husbands; 
3:6 as Sarah obeyed* Abraham, calling him lord; whose children you* became, doing good and not fearing any terror.</p>
<br>
<p>3:7 You* husbands, likewise, dwell together with <i>your</i>* <i>wives</i> according to <i>the</i> knowledge, bestowing honor to the wife, as the weaker vessel, as also being joint heirs of the grace of life; *that* your* prayers may not be hindered.</p>
<br>
<p>3:8 Now <i>to</i> the end, <i>be</i> like-minded, sympathetic, loving the brethren, affectionate, friendly; 
3:9 not giving evil in exchange-for evil or reviling in exchange-for reviling, but instead, speaking well of <i>others</i>; knowing that you* were called *for this, that* you* should inherit a blessing. 
3:10 For* he who wills to love* life and to see good days, let his tongue cease from <i>speaking</i> evil, and <i>also</i> his lips not to speak treachery. 
3:11 Let him shun evil and let him do good. Let him seek peace and let him pursue it, 
3:12 because the eyes of the Lord <i>are</i> upon the righteous and his ears toward their supplication. But the face of the Lord <i>is</i> against those who are practicing evil.</p>
<br>
<p>3:13 And who <i>is</i> he who will mistreat you*, if you* become imitators of what is good? 
3:14 But even if you* should suffer because of righteousness<i>, you</i>* <i>are</i> fortunate. But do not fear <i>because of</i> their fear, nor should you* be disturbed; 
3:15 but sanctify the Lord God in your* hearts, and <i>be</i> prepared habitually to <i>make</i> a defense to everyone who is asking you* for a reason concerning the hope <i>which is</i> in you*, with meekness and fear; 
3:16 having a good conscience; that*, in what they are speaking against you* as evildoers, they may be ashamed who are railing at your* good conduct in Christ. 
3:17 For* <i>it is</i> better to suffer for doing good than <i>for</i> doing evil, (if the will of God wills <i>it</i>). 
3:18 Because Christ also suffered once for all on behalf of <i>our</i> sins, the righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that* he might bring* you* to God; having indeed been slain in the flesh, but was given-life in the Spirit; 
3:19 in which, he also traveled and preached to the spirits in prison {Eph 2:17}, 
3:20 when* they previously were disobedient, when the patience of God was waiting in <i>the</i> days of Noah, <i>while</i> the ark <i>was</i> being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water; 
3:21 which also <i>our</i> counterpart– immersion* saves us now, not the removal of <i>the</i> filth of the flesh, but the demand of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ; 
3:22 who is at <i>the</i> right <i>hand</i> of God, having traveled into heaven; <i>with</i> messengers and authorities and powers having been made subject to him.</p>
<h3>1 Peter 4</h3>
<p>4:1 Therefore, Christ having suffered on our behalf <i>who are</i> in <i>the</i> flesh, you* also weaponize yourselves with the same mind, because he who has suffered in <i>the</i> flesh has ceased from sin; 
4:2 *that* you should no longer have <i>your</i> life, (the rest of your* time in the flesh), in the lusts of men, but in the will of God. 
4:3 For* the time which has passed away from <i>our</i> life is enough for us to have worked the will of the Gentiles, and to have conducted-ourselves in unbridled-lusts, lusts, drunkenness, revelings, drinking-bouts and illegal {immoral} idolatries; 
4:4 in which they, blaspheming, are surprised <i>by</i> you*, <i>that you are</i> not running together with <i>them</i> into the same outpouring of riotousness; 
4:5 who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 
4:6 For* to this <i>end</i> the good-news was proclaimed even to the dead, that* they might be judged indeed according to men in <i>the</i> flesh, but may live according to God in the Spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>4:7 But the end of all things has drawn near. Therefore, be sensible and be sober to prayers. 
4:8 But before all things, having the intense love* *for yourselves, because love* will hide a multitude of sins. 
4:9 <i>Be</i> hospitable to one another without murmurings; 
4:10 just-as each has received a gift*, serving it to yourselves, as good stewards of <i>the</i> various grace<i>s</i> of God. 
4:11 If anyone is speaking, <i>speak</i> as <i>the</i> oracles of God; if anyone is serving, <i>serve</i> as from the strength which God is supplying; that* God may be glorified in all things through Jesus Christ: to whom is the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>4:12 Beloved, do not be surprised by the fiery ordeal among you*, happening to you* *for a test, as <i>though</i> a strange thing is befalling to you*. 
4:13 But accordingly you* are sharing in the sufferings of Christ <i>with us</i>, rejoice, that* in the revelation of his glory, you* may also rejoice, being glad. 
4:14 If you* are reproached in <i>the</i> name of Christ<i>, you</i>* <i>are</i> fortunate, because the <i>Spirit</i> of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you*. He is indeed blasphemed according to their <i>manner</i>, but he is glorified according to your <i>manner</i>. 
4:15 For* let not anyone of you* suffer like a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or like a meddler in the affairs of others. 
4:16 But if <i>anyone suffers</i> as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this respect. 
4:17 Because the time <i>for</i> judgment <i>is</i> to begin from the house of God, and if <i>it begins</i> first from us, what <i>will be</i> the end of the disobedient to the good-news of God? 
4:18 And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and <i>the</i> sinner appear? 
4:19 So-then let them who also suffer according to the will of God in good-doing, be consigning their souls as to a faithful Creator.</p>
<h3>1 Peter 5</h3>
<p>5:1 I am encouraging the elders who <i>are</i> among you*, <i>as I,</i> who <i>am</i> a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partner of the glory which is about to be revealed. 
5:2 Shepherd the flock of God which <i>is</i> among you*, exercising the oversight, not by compulsion, but willfully, and not covetously, but eagerly; 
5:3 and not like <i>one</i> lording it over <i>his</i> inheritances {Or: lots}, but you* yourselves become examples to the flock. 
5:4 And when* the Chief-Shepherd has been manifested, you* will get the unfading crown of glory. 
5:5 Likewise, <i>the</i> younger <i>ones</i>, be subject to the elder <i>ones</i>. But all <i>of you</i>* be subject to one another, clothe yourself with humility, because ‘God resists <i>the</i> haughty, but is giving grace to <i>the</i> humble.’ {Prov. 3:34} 
5:6 Therefore humble yourselves under the powerful hand of God, that* he may exalt you* in time; 
5:7 having tossed forth all your* anxiety upon him, because there is care concerning you* with him. 
5:8 Be sober! Be watchful! Your* opponent, <i>the</i> Devil, like a roaring lion, is walking around seeking whom he may swallow, 
5:9 to whom you* are standing against, <i>being</i> solid in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are completed in your* brotherhood which <i>is</i> in <i>the</i> world. 
5:10 But the God of all grace, who called you* to his everlasting glory in Christ Jesus, when* you* have suffered a small <i>time</i>, he himself may frame you* <i>up</i>, will establish, will strengthen <i>and</i> will found <i>you*</i>. 
5:11 To him <i>is</i> the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>5:12 Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I count <i>him</i>, I have written to you* a few <i>words</i>, encouraging and testifying this to be <i>the</i> true grace of God into which you* are standing. 
5:13 She who is in Babylon, chosen together with <i>you</i>*, greets you*, and <i>so does</i> Mark my son. 
5:14 Greet one another with a kiss of love*.</p>
<p>To you* all who are in Christ Jesus, peace. Amen.</p>
<br>

<h3>2 Peter 1</h3>
<p>1:1 Simon Peter, a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who are allotted an equally precious faith with us, in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ: 
1:2 may grace and peace be multiplied to you* in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>1:3 As his divine* power has been bestowed to us as a gift, (all things <i>pertaining</i> to life and godliness*), through the full knowledge of him who called us through glory and virtue; 
1:4 through which he has bestowed to us as a gift, his precious and greatest promises; that* through these you* might become partners of the divine* nature, having fled away from the corruption in the world among <i>its</i> lust.</p>
<br>
<p>1:5 Now also <i>for</i> this same <i>reason</i>, besides having brought in all diligence, supply in your* faith, virtue, and in <i>your</i>* virtue, knowledge 
1:6 and in <i>your</i>* knowledge, self-control, and in <i>your</i>* self-control, endurance, and in <i>your</i>* endurance, godliness*; 
1:7 and in <i>your</i>* godliness*, brotherly-love, and in <i>your</i>* brotherly-love, love*. 
1:8 For* <i>if</i> these things exist and increase in you*, none <i>will</i> designate you* idle or unfruitful toward the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1:9 For* the one is blind in whom these things are not present*, <i>being</i> short-sighted, having taken <i>on himself the</i> forgetfulness of {i.e. deliberately forgot} the cleansing from his old sins. 
1:10 Hence brethren, be diligent to make* your* calling and choice steadfast; for* if you* are practicing these things, you* may never* trip; 
1:11 for* so the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly supplied to you*.</p>
<br>
<p>1:12 Hence, I will not neglect to remind you* habitually concerning these things, although you* know them and are established in the present* truth. 
1:13 But I am deeming <i>it</i> righteous, inasmuch as I am in this tabernacle, to arouse you* in a reminder; 
1:14 knowing that the removal of my tabernacle is <i>coming</i> quickly, just-as our Lord Jesus Christ indicated to me. 
1:15 But I will also be diligent, each-time, to have you* in remembrance of these things, to practice <i>them</i> after my exodus. 
1:16 For* we did not follow wisely devised fables, <i>when</i> we made known to you* the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but <i>in that</i>, we became eyewitnesses of that majesty. 
1:17 For* having received honor and glory from God the Father, when* such a voice was carried to him by the Majestic Glory, <b>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am delighted.</b> 
1:18 And we heard this voice, having been carried from heaven, being together with him in the holy mountain. 
1:19 And we have the steadfast prophetic word, (as to a lamp appearing in a dreary place, until the day should dawn and the {F} morning-star might rise), to which you* are doing well, <i>and</i> taking-heed in your* hearts. 
1:20 Knowing this first, that every prophecy of Scripture does not come* from <i>one’s</i> own interpretation. 
1:21 For* no prophecy was ever brought <i>about</i> by <i>the</i> will of man, but the holy men of God spoke <i>the word</i> being carried by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>{Footnotes: 2Pet 1:19, or: Venus; literally: ‘light-bearer’; metaphorically Jesus.}</p>
<h3>2 Peter 2</h3>
<p>2:1 But false prophets happened <i>to be</i> also among the people, as false teachers will also be among you*, who will smuggle in sects of destruction, denying even the Master who bought them, bringing* quick destruction upon themselves. 
2:2 And many will follow their unbridled-lusts, because of whom the way of the truth will be blasphemed<i>.</i> 
2:3 And in <i>their</i> greed, they will be merchants of you* with fabricated words; to whom the condemnation from long-ago is not idle, and their destruction will not slumber.</p>
<p>2:4 For* if God did not spare messengers who sinned, but threw them into hell and gave them to restraints of blackness, being kept *for judgment; 
2:5 and <i>if</i> he did not spare the ancient world, but guarded Noah, <i>the</i> eighth <i>person spared</i>, a preacher of righteousness, when* he brought* a flood upon the world of the ungodly; 
2:6 and <i>if by</i> incinerating the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, he condemned <i>them</i> to catastrophe, having placed them <i>as</i> an example <i>for</i> those who are about to be ungodly; 
2:7 and <i>if</i> he rescued righteous Lot, <i>who had been</i> subjugated by the conduct of the immoral in their unbridled-lusts 
2:8 (for* that righteous man, <i>who was</i> dwelling among them, was tormenting <i>his</i> righteous soul by seeing and hearing <i>their</i> lawless works day by day). 
2:9 The Lord knows how to rescue the devout out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous to a day of judgment to be punished; 
2:10 and especially those who are conducing-themselves after the flesh in the lust of defilement and despise lordship.</p>
<p>Daring <i>and</i> self-willed, they do not tremble to blaspheme <i>heavenly</i> glories; 
2:11 where messengers, (<i>though</i> being greater in strength and power), do not bring a blasphemous judgment against them before the Lord. 
2:12 But these <i>men are</i> like natural unreasoning creatures, having been born *for apprehension and corruption, blaspheming in what they are ignorant of, and in their corruption they will be utterly corrupted. 
2:13 They will be getting the wages of unrighteousness; <i>those</i> who deem <i>it</i> a sensual-delight <i>to be</i> carousing in <i>the</i> day<i>light</i>. <i>They are</i> stains and blemishes, carousing in their <i>own acts of</i> deception, they feast sumptuously alongside you*, 
2:14 having eyes full of an adulteress and unceasing sin; enticing unstable souls; having a heart exercised in greed; children of <i>the</i> curse; 
2:15 having left <i>the</i> straight way. They were misled, having followed in the way of Balaam the <i>son</i> of Beor, who loved* the wages of unrighteousness; 
2:16 but he had <i>his</i> reproof from his own violation of the law: a voiceless donkey, having spoken in a human voice, forbade the insanity of the prophet.</p>
<p>2:17 These <i>people</i> are waterless springs and clouds driven by a gale to whom the blackness of darkness has been kept forever. 
2:18 For* speaking flattering-words of futility, they entice (with* the lusts of the flesh to unbridled-lusts) those who really had fled away from those who conduct themselves in error. 
2:19 <i>They are</i> promising them freedom, when* they themselves are* bondservants of corruption. For* in what {Or: whom} anyone has been succumbed, in this {Or: him}, he has also been enslaved. 
2:20 For* if, having fled away from the defilements of the world in the full knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and having been again entangled, they are succumbed in these things, the last <i>state</i> has become worse to them <i>than</i> the first. 
2:21 For* it was better for them to have not known fully the way of righteousness, than, having fully known <i>it</i>, to turn back from the holy commandment given to them. 
2:22 But it has befallen them <i>as</i> the <i>way</i> of the true proverb, ‘<i>The</i> dog turning to his own vomit again,’ and the sow that <i>had</i> bathed, to wallowing in the mud. {Prov. 26:11}</p>
<h3>2 Peter 3</h3>
<p>3:1 Beloved, this is already the second letter that I am writing to you*, and in both of them I am awakening your* sincere mind in a reminder; 
3:2 to remember the declarations which have been spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of the Lord and Savior through your* apostles.</p>
<p>3:3 Knowing this first, that in the last of the days, mockers will come, conducting-themselves according to their own lusts, 
3:4 and saying, Where is the promise of his presence? For* from the day that the fathers fell-asleep, all things remain as they were from the beginning of the creation. 
3:5 For* this is eluding them, (willing <i>it to be so</i>): that there were heavens from long-ago, and an earth established {Or: standing together} out of water and through water by the word of God; 
3:6 through which <i>water</i>, the world <i>which was</i> then was destroyed, having been flooded in water. 
3:7 But the heavens and the earth that are now, by his word, have been stored up for fire, being kept to <i>the</i> day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</p>
<br>
<p>3:8 But beloved, let this one thing not elude you*, that one day with the Lord is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day. 
3:9 The Lord is not slow <i>concerning</i> his promise, as some deem slowness, but has patience toward us, not willing <i>for</i> any to perish, but <i>for</i> all to make room *for repentance.</p>
<p>3:10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night; in which the heavens will pass away with a crashing-sound, and the elements will be dissolved, being burnt with heat, and the earth and the works which are in it will be burned up. 
3:11 Therefore, <i>with</i> all these things being dissolved, <i>see</i> what sort of <i>things</i> you* ought to possess in <i>all</i> holy conduct and godliness*, 
3:12 expecting, and diligently wanting the presence of the day of God, because of which, <i>the</i> heavens will be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements <i>will</i> melt, being burnt with heat. 
3:13 But according to his promise, we are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which dwells righteousness.</p>
<br>
<p>3:14 Hence, beloved, expecting these things, be diligent that you* may be found in peace, unstained and unblemished in his sight. 
3:15 And deem the patience of our Lord <i>to be</i> salvation; just-as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you* according to the wisdom which was given to him; 
3:16 as also in all <i>his</i> letters, speaking in them concerning these things; in which some things are hard to perceive, which the unlearned and unstable are twisting, as <i>they</i> also <i>do with</i> the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction. 
3:17 Therefore beloved, knowing beforehand <i>these things</i>, guard yourselves, that* you* might not fall from your* own firmness, having been led away in the error of the immoral. 
3:18 But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Glory <i>is</i> to him, both now and to the <i>final</i> day of <i>this</i> age. Amen.</p>

<h3>1 John 1</h3>
<p>1:1 What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we saw and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life 
1:2 and the life was manifested and we have seen and testify and are reporting to you* the everlasting life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us. 
1:3 What we have seen and have heard, we report to you*, that* you* also may have fellowship with us, but also our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ; 
1:4 and we are writing these things, that* our joy may be fulfilled.</p>
<br>
<p>1:5 And this is the message which we have heard from him and are reporting to you*, that God is light and there is no darkness in him– none <i>at all</i>. 
1:6 If we should say that we have fellowship with him and <i>then</i> should walk in the darkness, we are lying to ourselves, and do not practice the truth. 
1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son is cleansing us from every sin. 
1:8 If we should say that we have no sin, we are misleading ourselves and the truth is not in us. 
1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous {F} to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 
1:10 If we should say that we have not sinned, we make* him a liar and his word is not in us.</p>
<br>
<p>{Footnotes: 1Jn 
1:9 is the abbreviated form of: ‘in order that he might forgive us the sins in us and <i>in order that</i> he might cleanse us from...’}</p>
<h3>1 John 2</h3>
<p>2:1 My little-children, these things I am writing to you* that* you* may not sin. And if anyone should sin, we have a Helper* with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. 
2:2 And he is the atonement concerning our sins, but not concerning ours only, but also concerning the whole world. 
2:3 And we know in this that we have known him; if we are keeping his commandments. 
2:4 He who says, I have known him and is not keeping his commandments, is a liar and the truth is not in him; 
2:5 but whoever keeps his word, truly the love* of God has been completed in him. We know in this that we are in him. 
2:6 He who says he abides in him, he also ought to walk so; just-as that <i>man</i> walked.</p>
<br>
<p>{The word ‘abide’ as used throughout the Letters of John also can be translated as ‘dwell’ or ‘remain’ (as in 2:19).}</p>
<br>
<p>2:7 Brethren, I write no new commandment to you*, but an old commandment which you* <i>have</i> had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you* <i>have</i> heard from the beginning. 
2:8 Again, I am writing a new commandment to you*, which is true in him and in you*, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already appearing. 
2:9 He who says he is in the light and hates his brother, is in the darkness even until now. 
2:10 He who loves* his brother abides in the light and there is no offense in him. 
2:11 But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and is walking in the darkness and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</p>
<br>
<p>2:12 I am writing to you*, <i>my</i> little-children, because <i>your</i>* sins have been forgiven you* because of his name. 
2:13 I am writing to you*, fathers, because you* have known him who <i>is</i> from <i>the</i> beginning. I write to you*, young-men, because you* have overcome the evil <i>one</i>. I write to you*, young-men, because you* have known the Father. 
2:14 I have written to you*, fathers, because you* have known him who is from <i>the</i> beginning. I have written to you*, young-men, because you* are strong and the word of God abides in you* and you* have overcome the evil <i>one</i>.</p>
<p>2:15 Do not love* the world, nor the things <i>which are</i> in the world. If anyone loves* the world, the love* of the Father is not in him. 
2:16 Because all the things <i>which are</i> in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the egotism of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world. 
2:17 And the world is passing away and its lust, but he who practices the will of God abides forever.</p>
<br>
<p>2:18 Children, it is the last hour and just-as you* <i>have</i> heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come* <i>to be</i>; hence we know that it is <i>the</i> last hour. 
2:19 They went out away from us, but they were not of* us; for* if they had been of* us, they would have remained with us, but <i>they went out</i>, that* they might be made manifest that all <i>of them</i> are not of* us. 
2:20 And you* have an anointing from the Holy One and you* know all things. 
2:21 I have not written to you* because you* do not know the truth, but because you* know it and because every lie is not from the truth. 
2:22 Who is the liar except he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who is denying the Father and the Son. 
2:23 Everyone who is denying the Son, he does not have the Father. 
2:24 Therefore let what you* <i>have</i> heard from the beginning abide in you*. If what you* <i>have</i> heard from <i>the</i> beginning abides in you*, you* will also abide in the Son and in the Father. 
2:25 And in this is the promise which he promised to us– everlasting life. 
2:26 I have written to you* these things concerning those who are misleading you*. 
2:27 And <i>as for</i> you*, the anointing which you* received from him abides in you* and you* have no need that* anyone should teach you*, but as the same anointing teaches you* concerning all things and is true and is not a lie and just-as it taught you*, you* will abide in him. 
2:28 And now, <i>my</i> little-children, abide in him; that*, whenever he is manifested, we should have boldness and should not be ashamed at his presence. 
2:29 If you* know that he is righteous, you* also know that everyone who practices righteousness has been born from him.</p>
<h3>1 John 3</h3>
<p>3:1 Behold what sort of love* the Father has given to us, that* we might be called children of God. Because of this, the world does not know you*, because it did not know him. 
3:2 Beloved, we are now <i>the</i> children of God and it was not yet manifested what we will be. But we know that, if he is manifested, we will be similar to him, because we will see him just-as he is. 
3:3 And everyone who has this hope <i>set</i> on him purifies himself, just-as that <i>man</i> is pure. 
3:4 Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness. 
3:5 And you* know that, that <i>man</i> was manifested in order that he might take away our sins, and in him is no sin. {Isa. 53:4} 
3:6 Everyone who abides in him is not sinning. Everyone who sins has not seen him, nor has known him. 
3:7 <i>My</i> little-children, let no one mislead you*. He who practices righteousness is righteous, just-as that <i>man</i> is righteous. 
3:8 He who practices sin is from the Devil, because from <i>the</i> beginning the Devil sins, to this <i>end</i> the Son of God was manifested, that* he might tear-down the works of the Devil. 
3:9 Everyone who has been born from God does not practice sin, because his seed abides in him and he is not able to <i>practice</i> sin, because he has been born from God. 
3:10 The children of God and the children of the Devil are apparent in this, everyone who does not practice righteousness is not from God and he who does not love* his brother. 
3:11 Because this is the message which you* <i>have</i> heard from <i>the</i> beginning, that* we should love* one another; 
3:12 not as Cain <i>who</i> was from the evil <i>one</i> and slaughtered his brother. And he slaughtered him because of what? Because his works were evil but his brother’s righteous. {Gen. 4:8}</p>
<br>
<p>3:13 Do not marvel my brethren, if the world hates you*. 
3:14 We know that we have stepped out of death into life, because we love* the brethren. He who does not love* <i>his</i> brother abides in death. 
3:15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer and you* know that no murderer has everlasting life abiding in him. 
3:16 We have known love* in this, because that <i>man</i> laid down his life on our behalf and we ought to lay <i>down</i> our lives on behalf of the brethren. 
3:17 But whoever should have the world’s good life and should view his brother having need and <i>then</i> should lock his heart* from him, how does the love* of God abide in him? 
3:18 My little-children, we should not love* in word, nor with <i>the</i> tongue, but in work and in truth. 
3:19 And we know in this that we are from the truth and will persuade our hearts before him; 
3:20 because if our heart condemns us, God is greater <i>than</i> our heart and he knows all things. 
3:21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have boldness toward God; 
3:22 and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we are keeping his commandments and practice the things which are pleasing in his sight. 
3:23 And this is his commandment, that* we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and should love* one another, just-as he gave commandment <i>to us</i>. 
3:24 And he who is keeping his commandments abides in him and he in him. And we know in this that he abides in us, from the Spirit whom he gave us.</p>
<h3>1 John 4</h3>
<p>4:1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, <i>to see</i> if they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 
4:2 You* know the Spirit of God in this. Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; 
4:3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus Christ <i>as</i> having come in the flesh, is not from God and this is the <i>spirit</i> of the antichrist, <i>of</i> which you* have heard, that it is coming, and now it is already in the world. 
4:4 You* are from God, <i>my</i> little-children and have overcome them, because greater is he who is in you* than he who is in the world. 
4:5 They are from the world; because of this they speak <i>as</i> from the world and the world hears them. 
4:6 We are from God. He who knows God, hears us; he who is not from God does not hear us. We know from this, {F} the spirit of the truth and the spirit of the deceit.</p>
<br>
<p>4:7 Beloved, we should love* one another, because love* is from God, and everyone who loves* has been born from God and knows God. 
4:8 He who does not love*, does not know God, because God is love*. 
4:9 In this, the love* of God was manifested in us, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world that* we might live through him. 
4:10 In this is love*, not that we loved* God, but that he loved* us and sent his Son <i>to be</i> the atonement on behalf of our sins. 
4:11 Beloved, if God so loved* us, we also ought to love* one another. 
4:12 No one has seen God at anytime; if we love* one another, God is abiding in us and his love* is completed in us. 
4:13 We know in this that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given to us from his Spirit. 
4:14 And we have seen and are testifying that the Father has sent the Son <i>to be</i> the Savior of the world. 
4:15 Whoever should confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God. 
4:16 And we have known and have believed the love* which God has in us. God is love*, and he who abides in love* abides in God and God abides in him. 
4:17 In this, love* has been completed with us, that* we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because just-as that man is <i>complete</i>, we <i>are</i>  also <i>complete</i> in this world. 
4:18 There is no fear in love*, but mature love* casts out the fear, because the fear has punishment, and he who fears has not been matured in love*. 
4:19 We love* him, because he loved* us first. 
4:20 If anyone should say, I love* God and <i>then</i> should hate his brother, he is a liar; for* he who does not love* his brother, whom he has seen, how is he able to love* God, whom he has not seen? 
4:21 And we have this commandment from him, that* he who loves* God should also love* his brother.</p>

<h3>1 John 5</h3>
<p>5:1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born from God and everyone who loves* him who fathered <i>us</i>, also loves* him who has been born from him. 
5:2 We know in this that we love* the children of God, whenever we love* God and <i>whenever</i> we are keeping his commandments. 
5:3 For* this is the love* of God, that* we should keep his commandments and his commandments are not burdensome. 
5:4 Because everyone who has been born from God overcomes the world and this is the victory, our faith, that has overcome the world. 
5:5 Who is he who overcomes the world, except he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 
5:6 This is he who came through water and blood– Jesus Christ; not only in the water, but in the water and in the blood. And it is the Spirit who is testifying, because the Spirit is the truth. 
5:7 Because there are three who are testifying, 
5:8 {T} the Spirit and the water and the blood and the three are into the one {i.e. agree}. 
5:9 If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, because the testimony of God is this: that he has testified concerning his Son. 
5:10 He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God, has made* him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning his Son. 
5:11 And the testimony is this, that God gave to us everlasting life and this life is in his Son. 
5:12 He who has the Son, has life; he who does not have the Son of God, does not have the life.</p>
<br>
<p>5:13 I have written these things to you* who believe in the name of the Son of God, that* you* may know that you* have everlasting life, and that* you* may believe in the name of the Son of God. 
5:14 And this is the boldness which we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us; 
5:15 and if we know that he hears us whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from him. 
5:16 If anyone sees his brother sinning {F} sin not to death, he will ask and <i>God</i> will give him life <i>for</i> those who are not sinning to death. There is {F} sin to death. I do not say that* he should ask concerning that. 
5:17 All unrighteousness is sin and there is sin not <i>leading</i> to death.</p>
<br>
<p>5:18 We know that everyone who has been born from God is not sinning, but he who was born from God guards himself and the evil <i>one</i> does not touch him. 
5:19 We know that we are from God and the whole world lays in the evil <i>one</i>. 
5:20 Now we know that the Son of God <i>has</i> come and has given us perception, that* we might know him who is true and we are in him who is true, <i>that is,</i> in his son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and the everlasting life. 
5:21 <i>My</i> little-children, guard yourselves from idols. Amen.</p>

<h3>2 John</h3>
<p>1:1 The elder to <i>the</i> chosen {F} lady and her children, whom I love* in truth, and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth; 
1:2 because of the truth which abides in us and it will be with us forever. 
1:3 Grace, mercy, peace will be with us, from God the Father and from <i>the</i> Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love*.</p>
<br>
<p>1:4 I rejoice exceedingly that I have found <i>some</i> out of your children walking in truth, just-as we received commandment from the Father. 
1:5 And now I ask you {F} lady, not as <i>though</i> I write to you a new commandment, but what we <i>have</i> had from <i>the</i> beginning, that* we should love* one another. 
1:6 And this is love*, that* we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just-as you* <i>have</i> heard from <i>the</i> beginning, that* you* should walk in it. 
1:7 Because many misleaders have entered into the world, those who are not confessing Jesus Christ <i>as</i> coming in the flesh. This is the misleader and the antichrist. 
1:8 Beware <i>in</i> yourselves, that* you* should not destroy the things which we have worked <i>in you</i>*, but <i>that*</i> we may receive a full reward. 
1:9 Everyone who transgresses and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. He who abides in the teaching of Christ, this <i>one</i> has both the Father and the Son. 
1:10 If anyone is coming to you* and is not bringing this teaching, do not receive him into <i>your</i>* house and do not say hello to him; 
1:11 for* he who says hello to him is sharing in his evil works.</p>
<br>
<p>1:12 Having many things to write to you*, I did not plan <i>to write them</i> through paper and ink, but I am hoping to come to you* and to speak mouth to mouth { i.e., face to face}, that* our joy may be fulfilled. 
1:13 The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>{Footnotes: 2Jn 1:1,5, or: Kyria; (a proper name). Lady is most likely a salutation like ‘Sir’ or ‘Lady,’ used figuratively for a congregation* which fits the plural you* &amp; singular you in verse 12-13.}</p>

<h3>3 John</h3>
<p>1:1 The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love* in truth. 
1:2 Beloved, I am praying <i>for</i> you to prosper and to be sound {Or: healthy} concerning all things, just-as your soul prospers. 
1:3 For* I rejoiced exceedingly of brethren coming and testifying of <i>your</i> truth, just-as you are walking in truth. 
1:4 I have no greater joy from these things, that* I may hear my children <i>are</i> walking in the truth.</p>
<br>
<p>1:5 Beloved, you practice faithfully whatever you have worked toward the brethren and toward strangers; 
1:6 who testified to your* love* in the sight of <i>the</i> congregation*; whom you will do well to send onward worthily of God. 
1:7 For* they went forth on behalf of the Name, taking nothing from the Gentiles. 
1:8 Therefore we ought to receive those <i>who are</i> such, that* we should become fellow workers for the truth.</p>
<br>
<p>1:9 I wrote to the congregation*, but Diotrephes, who loves to be their foremost <i>one</i>, is not accepting us. 
1:10 Because of this, if I come, I will remind <i>him of</i> his works which he practices, gossiping against us with evil words and not being content in these, nor does he himself accept the brethren and those who plan <i>to come</i>, he forbids and casts <i>them</i> out of the congregation*.</p>
<br>
<p>1:11 Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who practices good is from God. He who practices evil has not seen God. 
1:12 <i>As</i> for Demetrius, he has been testified of by all and by the truth itself. But we also are testifying and you* know that our testimony is true.</p>
<br>
<p>1:13 I had many things to write <i>to you</i>, but I do not wish to write <i>them</i> to you through ink and reed. 
1:14 But I hope to see you immediately and we will speak mouth to mouth {i.e., face to face}. Peace to you*. The friends greet you*. Greet the friends according to name.</p>

<h3>Jude</h3>
<p>1:1 Jude, a bondservant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, to the called, those who have been sanctified in God the Father and have been kept in Jesus Christ: 
1:2 mercy to you*, and may peace and love* be multiplied.</p>
<br>
<p>1:3 Beloved, making* all diligence to write to you* concerning our common salvation, I had a necessity to write to you* encouraging you* to earnestly fight for the faith which was given once for all to the holy-ones.</p>
<br>
<p>1:4 For* some men sneaked in <i>among you*</i>, those who have been written <i>about, from</i> long-ago *for this condemnation <i>of the</i> ungodly, <i>who are</i> transferring the grace of our God into unbridled-lusts and denying our only Master, God <i>the Father</i>, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>1:5 But I wish to remind you*, <i>though</i> you* knowing this once for all, that the Lord, having saved people out of the land of Egypt; a second-time, he destroyed those who did not believe. 
1:6 And the messengers who did not keep <i>to</i> their own principality, but having left their own house, he has kept to the judgment of <i>the</i> great day in eternal bonds under blackness. 
1:7 As Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them in a similar manner with these, having indulged in fornication and having gone after different flesh, lay before <i>us</i> as an example, held under the sentence of everlasting fire. {Gen 19:1-38}</p>
<p>1:8 Nevertheless, these dreaming likewise, also indeed are defiling the flesh and are rejecting lordship and are blaspheming <i>the heavenly</i> glories<i>.</i></p>
<p>1:9 But Michael the archangel, when arguing with the Devil, <i>after</i> he was reasoning concerning the body of Moses, he did not dare to bring a judging of blasphemy against him, but said, The Lord rebuke you. {Deu 34: 5,6}</p>
<p>1:10 But these <i>men</i>, they indeed blaspheme as many things as they do not know. But as many things as they know naturally, like the unreasoning creatures <i>that they are</i>, they corrupt themselves in those things.</p>
<p>1:11 Woe to them! Because they traveled in the way of Cain and poured themselves into the error of Balaam’s reward and perished in the dispute of Korah. {Gen 4:8; Num 22:1-41; Num 16:1-50}</p>
<p>1:12 These <i>people</i> are hidden-reefs in your* love-feasts, sumptuously feasting fearlessly alongside <i>you</i>*, shepherding themselves, <i>they are</i> waterless clouds, being carried away by <i>the</i> winds; unfruitful autumn trees, twice dead, having been uprooted, 
1:13 wild waves of the sea, foaming forth their own shames, misleading stars– for whom the blackness of darkness has been kept forever.</p>
<p>1:14 Now Enoch, seventh from Adam, also prophesied <i>about</i> these <i>people</i>, saying, Behold, the Lord {F} came in <i>among</i> tens of thousands <i>of</i> his holy-ones, 
1:15 to make a judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly of them, concerning all their works of ungodliness which they did <i>in</i> ungodly <i>ways</i> and concerning all the hard <i>things</i> which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</p>
<p>1:16 These <i>men</i> are murmurers, complainers, conducting-themselves according to their lusts and their mouth is speaking flattering-words, admiring faces because of profit.</p>
<br>
<p>1:17 But you*, beloved, remember the declarations which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
1:18 that they were saying to you* that in the last time there will be mockers, conducting-themselves according to their own lusts of ungodlinesses. 
1:19 These are the ones who are causing-splits, <i>who are</i> physical, not having <i>the</i> Spirit. 
1:20 But as for you*, beloved, <i>keep</i> building yourselves up in your* most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>1:21 Keep yourselves in God’s love*, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ *for everlasting life. 
1:22 And indeed show-mercy to some, making a distinction; 
1:23 but save others in fear, seizing them out of the fire, hating even the tunic which has been stained from the flesh.</p>
<br>
<p>1:24 Now to him who is able to guard us from falling and to stand <i>us</i> in the sight of his glory, unblemished in gladness, 
1:25 to the only wise God our Savior, <i>is the</i> glory <i>and</i> majesty, dominion and authority, both now and forever. Amen.</p>

<h3>Revelation 1</h3>
<p>1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his bondservants; what things are essential to happen shortly and he signified <i>it</i>, having sent <i>it</i> through his messenger to his bondservant John; 
1:2 who testifies of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ; as many things as he saw. 
1:3 He who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and <i>are</i> keeping the things which have been written in it <i>are</i> fortunate; for* the time <i>is</i> near.</p>
<br>
<p>1:4 John to the seven congregations* which are in Asia: grace to you* and peace from God who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits that are in the sight of his throne; 
1:5 and from Jesus Christ, <i>who is</i> the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves* us and bathed us from our sins in his blood; 
1:6 and he made* us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father; to him <i>is</i> the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen. {Rev 5:10, 20:6}</p>
<p>1:7 Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him and those who stabbed him, and all the tribes of the earth will grieve over him. Yes <i>he comes</i>, Amen.</p>
<p>1:8 <b>I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, Who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty</b>.</p>
<p>1:9 I John, your* brother and partner in affliction and <i>the</i> kingdom and endurance <i>which are</i> in Christ Jesus, happened <i>to be</i> on the island called Patmos, because of the word of God and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ. 
1:10 I became in the spirit on the Lord’s day and I heard behind me a loud voice, like <i>that</i> of a trumpet 
1:11 saying, <b>What you see, write in a book and send <i>it</i> to the seven congregations*: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamus and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.</b> 
1:12 And I turned there to see the voice which was speaking with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lamp-stands; 
1:13 and in the middle of the seven lamp-stands one similar to a son of man, he has clothed himself with a long-robe and girded around the breasts with a golden belt. 
1:14 Now his head and his hair were white like white wool, <i>like</i> snow, and his eyes were like a flame of fire; 
1:15 and his feet similar to polished brass, like what has been refined in a furnace, and his voice like the voice of many waters. 
1:16 And he had in his right hand seven stars and a sharp two edged sword traveled out from his mouth and his appearance was as the sun appears in its power. 
1:17 And when I saw him, I fell before his feet like one dead. And he placed his right <i>hand</i> upon me, saying, <b>Do not fear; I am the first and the last,</b> 
1:18 <b>and the Living One, and I became dead and behold, I am living forever and ever and I have the keys of death and of Hades. Amen.</b> 
1:19 <b>Therefore write the things which you saw, and the things which are, and the things which are about to happen after these things.</b> 
1:20 <b>The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right <i>hand</i> and the seven golden lamp-stands <i>is this</i>: the seven stars are the messengers of the seven congregations* and the seven lamp-stands are seven congregations*.</b></p>
<h3>Revelation 2</h3>
<p>2:1 <b>Write to the messenger of the congregation* in Ephesus:</b></p>
<p><b>He who is holding-fast the seven stars in his right <i>hand</i> and who is walking in the middle of the seven golden lamp-stands says these things:</b> 
2:2 <b>I know your works and your labor and endurance and that you are not able to bear evil men and you tested those who are saying* <i>about</i> themselves, They are apostles and are not and you have found them false;</b> 
2:3 <b>and you have endurance and did bear because of my name and have not fatigued.</b> 
2:4 <b>But I have <i>this</i> against you; that you left your first love*.</b> 
2:5 <b>Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works; otherwise I am coming to you shortly and will move your lamp-stand out of its place, if you do not repent.</b> 
2:6 <b>But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.  </b>
2:7 <b>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations*. To him who is overcoming, I will give to him to eat from the Tree of Life, which is in <i>the</i> middle of the Paradise of God.</b></p>
<br>
<p>2:8 <b>And write to the messenger of the congregation* in Smyrna:</b></p>
<p><b>The first and the last, who became dead and lived <i>again</i> says these things:</b> 
2:9 <b>I know your works, your affliction and your poverty (but you are rich) and the blasphemy of those who say they are themselves Jews and they are not, but are a synagogue of the Adversary.</b> 
2:10 <b>Let no one fear the things which you are about to suffer. Behold indeed, the Devil is about to cast <i>some</i> from you* into prison, in order that you* may be tested and you* will have affliction ten days. Become faithful to death and I will give you the crown of life.</b> 
2:11 <b>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations*. He who is overcoming may never* be hurt from the second death.</b></p>
<br>
<p>2:12 <b>And write to the messenger of the congregation* in Pergamus:</b></p>
<p><b>He who has the sharp two edged sword says these things:</b> 
2:13 <b>I know your works and where you dwell– where the Adversary’s throne is, and you are holding-fast my name and did not deny my faith in the days of Antipas, my witness, my faithful one, who was killed by you*, where the Adversary is dwelling.</b> 
2:14 <b>But I have a few things against you, because you have there <i>some</i> holding-fast the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast an offense in the sight the sons of Israel, to eat idol-sacrifices and to fornicate.</b> 
2:15 <b>So you also have <i>some </i> holding-fast the similar teaching of the Nicolaitans.</b>  
2:16 <b>Therefore repent; otherwise I am coming to you shortly and make war with them with* the sword of my mouth.</b> 
2:17 <b>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations*. To him who is overcoming, I will give to him to eat from the hidden manna and I will give him a white voting-pebble and a new name that has been written upon the voting-pebble, which no one knows except he who is receiving it.</b></p>
<br>
<p>2:18 <b>And write to the messenger of the congregation* in Thyatira:</b></p>
<p><b>The Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire and his feet are similar to polished brass says these things:</b> 
2:19 <b>I know your works and love* and faith and service and endurance and that your last works are more-than the first.</b> 
2:20 <b>But I have <i>this</i> against you, that you are allowing your woman</b> {Or: wife} <b>Jezebel, she <i>who</i> calls herself a prophetess, and she <i>who</i> is teaching and misleading my bondservants to fornicate and to eat idol-sacrifices.</b>  
2:21 <b>And I gave her time, in order that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent from her fornication.</b> 
2:22 <b>Behold, I cast her onto a bed and those who are committing adultery with her into great affliction, if they do not repent from her works.</b> 
2:23 <b>And I will kill her children with* death, and all the congregations* will know that I am he who is searching the brains and hearts and I will give to you*, each <i>one</i> according to your* works.</b> 
2:24  <b>But I am saying to you* and to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as are not holding <i>to</i> this teaching, who did not know the deep <i>things</i> of the Adversary, as they are saying, I cast upon you* no other burden.</b> 
2:25 <b>However hold-fast <i>to</i> what you* have, till whenever I have come.</b> 
2:26 <b>And he who is overcoming and he who is keeping my works to the end, to him I will give authority over the nations.</b> 
2:27  <b>And he will shepherd them with* an iron rod, as the vessels of the potter will be crushed; as I have also received of my Father;</b> 
2:28 <b>and I will give him the morning star.</b> 
2:29 <b>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations*.</b></p>
<h3>Revelation 3</h3>
<br>
<p>3:1 <b>And write to the messenger of the congregation* in Sardis:</b></p>
<p><b>He who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars says these things: I know your works, that you have a name, that you live; and you are dead.</b> 
3:2 <b>Become watchful and establish the rest of the things, which were about to be cast away; for* I have not found your works having been fulfilled in the sight of my God.</b> 
3:3 <b>Therefore remember how you have received and heard, and keep <i>it</i> and repent. Therefore if you do not watch, I will come upon you like a thief and you may never* know what hour I will come upon you.</b> 
3:4 <b>But you have a few names in Sardis who did not defile their garments and they will walk with me in white, because they are worthy.</b> 
3:5 <b>He who is overcoming this, he will be dressed in white garments, and I will never* wipe-away his name out of the Book of Life and I will confess his name in the sight of my Father and in the sight of his messengers.</b> 
3:6 <b>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations*.</b></p>
<br>
<p>3:7 <b>And write to the messenger of the congregation* in Philadelphia:</b></p>
<p><b>He who is holy, who is true, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will lock and who locks and no one opens says these things:</b> 
3:8 <b>I know your works (behold, I have given <i>you</i> an opened door <i>which is</i> in your sight, which no one is able to lock), that you have little power and kept my word and did not deny my name.</b> 
3:9 <b>Behold, I give <i>them</i> from the synagogue of the Adversary, those who say they are themselves Jews and they are not, but are lying. Behold, I will make* them that* they should come and should worship in the sight of your feet and should know that I have loved* you.</b> 
3:10 <b>Because you kept the word of my endurance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, that <i>hour</i> which is about to come upon the whole inhabited-earth, to test those who are dwelling upon the earth.</b> 
3:11 <b>I am coming shortly. Hold-fast what you have, in order that no one may take your crown.</b> 
3:12 <b>He who is overcoming, I will make* him a pillar in the temple of my God and he may never* go outside anymore and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God and my own new name.</b> 
3:13 <b>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations*.</b></p>
<br>
<p>3:14 <b>And write to the messenger of the congregation* in Laodicea:</b></p>
<p><b>The Amen, the faithful and true witness, <i>the one in</i> the beginning</b> {or originator, Jn 1:2} <b>of the creation of God, says these things:</b> 
3:15 <b>I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish-that you might be cold or hot.</b> 
3:16 <b>So because you are lukewarm and not hot nor cold, I am about to puke you out of my mouth.</b> 
3:17 <b>Because you say, I am rich and have enriched <i>ourselves</i> and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are the miserable and the pitiful and <i>are</i> poor and blind and naked.</b> 
3:18 <b>I am counseling you to buy gold from me, what has been refined from fire, in order that you may be enriched, and that* you should dress yourself <i>with</i> white garments and <i>that*</i> the shame of your nakedness should not be manifested <i>to all</i>, and that* you may anoint your eyes with eye-salve, in order that you may see.</b> 
3:19 <b>As many as I should love, I reprove and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.</b> 
3:20 <b>Behold, I am standing at the door and knocking; if anyone hears my voice and <i>if</i> he opens the door, I will enter to him and will dine with him and he with me.</b> 
3:21 <b>He who is overcoming, I will give to him to sit with me in my throne, as I also overcame and sat down with my Father in his throne.</b> 
3:22 <b>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations*.</b></p>
<h3>Revelation 4</h3>
<p>4:1 After these things, I saw and behold, a door has been opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard, <i>a voice</i> like <i>that</i> of a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here and I will show you what things are essential to happen after these things. 
4:2 And immediately I became in the spirit and behold, a throne was laying in heaven and <i>he was</i> sitting upon the throne, 
4:3 and he who was sitting, <i>was</i> similar in appearance <i>to</i> a jasper stone and a carnelian and <i>there was</i> a rainbow surrounding the throne, similar in appearance to an emerald. 
4:4 And twenty-four thrones <i>were</i> surrounding the throne and twenty-four elders sitting upon the thrones, having been dressed in white garments, and upon their heads golden crowns. 
4:5 And lightnings and voices and thunders traveled out from the throne. And <i>there were</i> seven torches of fire burning in the sight of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God; 
4:6 and in the sight of his throne, like a glassy sea similar to crystal, and in the middle of the throne and surrounding the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind. 
4:7 And the first living creature <i>was</i> similar to a lion and the second living creature <i>was</i> similar to a calf and the third living creature having a face like <i>that</i> of a man and the fourth living creature <i>was</i> similar to a flying eagle. 
4:8 And the four living creatures, themselves, having six wings apiece, are full of eyes, surrounding and inside and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, <i>is</i> the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come. 
4:9 And whenever the living creatures gave glory and honor and thanks to him who is sitting upon the throne, to him who lives forever and ever, 
4:10 the twenty-four elders will fall down in his sight who is sitting upon the throne and will worship him who is living forever and ever and will cast their crowns in the sight of the throne, saying, 
4:11 Worthy are you, our Lord and our God– the holy one, to receive the glory and the honor and the power because you created all things and because they are your will and were created.</p>
<h3>Revelation 5</h3>
<p>5:1 And I saw upon the right <i>hand</i> of him who sat upon the throne a book having been written inside and <i>on</i> the back, having been sealed with seven seals. 
5:2 And I saw a strong messenger preaching with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to loose its seals? 
5:3 And no one in the heaven or upon the earth or underneath the earth, was able to open the book or to look at it. 
5:4 And I was weeping much, because no one was found worthy to open and to read the book or to look at it. 
5:5 And one from the elders says to me, Do not weep; behold, the Lion who is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome, <i>so as</i> to open the book and its seven seals. 
5:6 And I saw in the middle of the throne and of the four living creatures and in <i>the</i> middle of the elders, a Lamb standing, as <i>one</i> having been slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, having been sent forth into all the earth. 
5:7 And he came and has received <i>it</i> out of the right <i>hand</i> of him who sat upon the throne. 
5:8 And when he took the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down in the Lamb’s sight, each <i>one</i> having a harp and golden bowls full of incenses, which are the prayers of the holy-ones. 
5:9 And they are singing a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book and to open its seals, because you were slaughtered and bought us for God in your blood from every tribe and language and people and nation.</p>
<p>5:10 And you made* them kings and priests to our God, and they will reign over the earth. {Rev 1:6, 20:6}</p>
<p>5:11 And I saw and I heard a voice like <i>that</i> of many messengers; and the living creatures and the elders surrounding the throne, tens of thousands of tens of thousands; 
5:12 saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb who has been slaughtered to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing. 
5:13 And every created thing which is in the heaven and upon the earth and underneath the earth and upon the sea and all things in them, I heard saying, To him who is sitting upon the throne and to the Lamb, <i>is</i> the blessing and the honor and the glory and the dominion, forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>5:14 And the four living creatures are saying, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshiped <i>him</i>.</p>
<h3>Revelation 6</h3>
<p>6:1 And I saw that the Lamb opened one out of the seven seals and I heard one out of the four living creatures saying like a voice of thunder, Come! 
6:2 And I saw and behold a white horse and he who sat upon it had a bow, and a crown was given to him and he came forth overcoming and that* he might overcome.</p>
<br>
<p>6:3 And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come. 
6:4 And another <i>horse</i> came forth, a red horse, and to him who sat upon it was given to take peace from the earth, that* they should slaughter one another and a great sword was given to him.</p>
<br>
<p>6:5 And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come and behold. And behold, I saw a black horse and he who sat upon it had a balance in his hand. 
6:6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A liter container of wheat for a denarius and three liter containers of barley for a denarius, and do not hurt the oil and the wine.</p>
<br>
<p>6:7 And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come and behold. 
6:8 And behold, a pale-green horse and he who sat upon him, his name was Death and Hades was following with him. And there was given to him authority over the fourth <i>part</i> of the earth, to kill with* sword and with* famine and with* death and by the beasts of the earth.</p>
<br>
<p>6:9 And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who have been slaughtered because of the word of God and because of the testimony of the lamb which they were holding <i>to</i>. 
6:10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, Until when, O holy and true Master, do you not judge and avenge our blood from those who dwell upon the earth? 
6:11 And a white robe was given to each, and it was said to them, that* they should still rest themselves <i>for</i> a time, until both their fellow bondservants and those who are about to be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</p>
<br>
<p>6:12 And I saw when he opened the sixth seal and a great earthquake happened, and the sun became black like hairy sackcloth and the whole moon became like blood; 
6:13 and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth, like a fig tree, having cast its unripe <i>figs when</i> being shaken by a great wind. 
6:14 And the heaven departed like a scroll being coiled up, and every mountain and <i>every</i> island were moved out of their places. 
6:15 And the kings of the earth and the great-men and the commanders and the rich and the strong and every bondservant and free <i>man</i>, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains; 
6:16 and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall upon us and hide us from the face of him who is sitting upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb; 
6:17 for* the great day of his wrath has come, and who is able to stand?</p>
<h3>Revelation 7</h3>
<p>7:1 After this I saw four messengers standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding-fast the four winds of the earth, in order that no wind should blow upon the earth nor upon the sea nor upon any tree. 
7:2 And I saw another messenger ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four messengers to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, 
7:3 saying, Do not hurt the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we might seal the bondservants of our God upon their foreheads.</p>
<p>7:4 And I heard the number of those who have been sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, having been sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel: 
7:5 twelve thousand out of the tribe of Judah having been sealed; twelve thousand out of the tribe of Reuben; twelve thousand out of the tribe of Gad; 
7:6 twelve thousand out of the tribe of Asher; twelve thousand out of the tribe of Naphtali; twelve thousand out of the tribe of Manasseh; 
7:7 twelve thousand out of the tribe of Simeon; twelve thousand out of the tribe of Levi; twelve thousand out of the tribe of Issachar; 
7:8 twelve thousand out of the tribe of Zebulun; twelve thousand out of the tribe of Joseph; twelve thousand out of the tribe of Benjamin having been sealed.</p>
<br>
<p>7:9 After these things, I saw and behold, a large crowd, which no one was able to number, out of every nation and tribes and peoples and languages, standing in the sight of the throne and in the sight of the Lamb, having been dressed in white robes and palm trees in their hands; 
7:10 and they are crying with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who is sitting upon the throne and to the Lamb.</p>
<p>7:11 And all the messengers and the elders and the four living creatures stood surrounding the throne, and they fell upon their faces in the sight of the throne and worshiped God, 
7:12 saying, Amen: the blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength to our God forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>7:13 And one out of the elders answered, saying to me, These who have been dressed in white robes, who are they and from where did they come?</p>
<p>7:14 And I said to him, My lord, you know.</p>
<p>And he said to me, These are those who are coming out of the great affliction and they <i>have</i> rinsed their robes and made <i>them</i> white in the blood of the Lamb. 
7:15 Because of this, they are in the sight of the throne of God, and they give-divine service to him day and night in his temple and he who is sitting upon the throne will reside over them. 
7:16 They will not be hungry anymore, nor thirsty anymore; nor should <i>the heat of</i> the sun fall upon them, nor any heat, 
7:17 because the Lamb, who is in the midst of the throne, is shepherding them and is guiding them to the springs of waters of life and God will wipe-away every tear from their eyes.</p>
<h3>Revelation 8</h3>
<p>8:1 And when he opened the seventh seal, there became a silence in heaven <i>for</i> approximately a half hour. 
8:2 And I saw the seven messengers who are standing in God’s sight, and seven trumpets were given to them.</p>
<p>8:3 And another messenger came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer, and many incenses were given to him in order that he should give it to the prayers of all the holy-ones upon the golden altar which was in the sight of the throne. 
8:4 And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the holy-ones, went up in God’s sight out of the messenger’s hand. 
8:5 And the messenger has taken the censer, and he filled it from the fire of the altar and cast it upon the earth and there became thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.</p>
<br>
<p>8:6 And the seven messengers who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves in order they might sound <i>them</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>8:7 And the first <i>trumpet</i> sounded and there became hail and fire, having been mixed in blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third of the earth was burnt up and the third of the trees was burnt up and all <i>the</i> pale-green grass was burnt up.</p>
<br>
<p>8:8 And the second messenger sounded and <i>something</i> like a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third of the sea became blood; 
8:9 and the third of the created things, (those who had life), died which were in the sea, and the third of the ships decayed.</p>
<br>
<p>8:10 And the third messenger sounded and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch and it fell upon the third of the rivers and upon the springs of the waters; 
8:11 and the name of the star is called* Wormwood and the third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.</p>
<br>
<p>8:12 And the fourth messenger sounded and the third of the sun was pounded and the third of the moon and the third of the stars; in order that the third of them should be darkened and the day might not appear <i>for</i> the third of it and the night likewise.</p>
<br>
<p>8:13 And I saw and I heard an eagle, flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to those who are dwelling upon the earth, from the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three messengers, who are about to sound.</p>
<h3>Revelation 9</h3>
<p>9:1 And the fifth messenger sounded and I saw a star from heaven has fallen to the earth and the key of the pit of the abyss was given to him. 
9:2 And he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke of a burning furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of the pit. 
9:3 And locusts came forth out of the smoke upon the earth, and authority was given to them, like the scorpions of the earth have authority. 
9:4 And it was said to them that* they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any pale-green thing, nor any tree, except only men who do not have the seal of God upon their foreheads. 
9:5 And it was given to them that* they should not kill them, but that* they should be tormented five months and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, whenever it strikes a man. 
9:6 And in those days men will seek death and will never* find it, and they will desire to die and death will flee from them. 
9:7 And the likeness of the locusts <i>were</i> similar to horses, having been prepared *for war, and upon their heads like crowns similar to gold and their faces were like men’s faces. 
9:8 And they had hair like the hair of women and their teeth were like <i>the teeth</i> of lions. 
9:9 And they had breastplates, like iron breastplates, and the sound {Or: voice or language} of their wings was like the sound of chariots, of many horses running to war. 
9:10 And they have tails similar to scorpions and stings, and they have their authority in their tails to hurt men <i>for</i> five months. 
9:11 They have the messenger of the abyss as king over them. His name in Hebrew is Abbadon but in the Greek <i>language</i> he has the name Apollyon.</p>
<br>
<p>9:12 The first Woe has gone away. Behold, two Woes still are coming after these things.</p>
<br>
<p>9:13 And the sixth messenger sounded and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the golden altar which is in God’s sight, 
9:14 <i>someone</i> saying to the sixth messenger who has the trumpet, Loose the four messengers that have been bound upon the great river Euphrates. 
9:15 And the four messengers were loosed, that have been prepared *for the hour and day and month and year, that* they should kill the third of men. 
9:16 And the number of the armies of the horse<i>men</i> was twice tens of thousands of tens of thousands {i.e. an infinite number}. I heard the number of them. 
9:17 And so I saw the horses in the vision and those who sat upon them, having fiery breastplates of hyacinth and of brimstone and the heads of lions; and fire and smoke and brimstone is traveling out from their mouths. 
9:18 From these three wounds, the third of men was killed from the fire and the smoke and the brimstone, which traveled out from their mouths. 
9:19 For* the authority of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails; for* their tails are similar to serpents and have heads, and they hurt <i>men</i> with* them. 
9:20 And the rest of mankind, who were not killed with* these wounds, did not repent of the works of their hands, that* they should not worship the demons and the golden and silver and the brass and the stone and the wooden idols; which are not able to see, nor hear, nor walk. 
9:21 And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their stealing.</p>
<h3>Revelation 10</h3>
<p>10:1 And I saw a strong messenger coming down from heaven, having been dressed with a cloud, and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was like the sun and his feet like pillars of fire; 
10:2 and having in his hand, a book, having been opened and he placed his right foot upon the sea and his left upon the earth; 
10:3 and he cried with a loud voice, just-like a lion roars and when he cried, the seven thunders spoke their voices.</p>
<p>10:4 And when the seven thunders spoke <i>their voices</i>, I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders spoke and do not write them. 
10:5 And the messenger whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his right hand to heaven, 
10:6 and swore by him who is living forever and ever, who created the heaven and the things in it and the earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it– that <i>there</i> will be no longer a <i>delay of</i> time. 
10:7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger, whenever he is about to sound, and the mystery of God <i>had</i> completed, as he proclaimed the good-news to his bondservants, the prophets. 
10:8 And the voice which I heard from heaven, <i>I heard it</i> again speaking with me and saying, Go, take the book which has been opened in the hand of the messenger who is standing upon the sea and upon the earth. 
10:9 And I went to the messenger, saying to him that he should give me the book.</p>
<p>And he says to me, Take it and eat it up, and it will make your belly bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet like honey. 
10:10 And I took the book out of the messenger’s hand and ate it up, and it was sweet like honey in my mouth and when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.</p>
<p>10:11 And they are saying to me, It is essential for you to prophesy again over many peoples and nations and languages and kings.</p>
<h3>Revelation 11</h3>
<p>11:1 And a reed similar to a rod was given to me and one says, Arise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who are worshiping in it. 
11:2 And the courtyard which is outside the temple cast outside and do not measure it, because it has been given to the nations and they will trample on the holy city forty-two months.</p>
<p>11:3 And I will give to my two witnesses and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, having been dressed in sackcloth. {Rev 11:9, 11:11, 12:6, 12:14} 
11:4 These are the two olive trees and the two lamp-stands, standing in the sight of the Lord of the earth. 
11:5 And if anyone wishes to hurt them, fire travels out from their mouth and devours their enemies, and if anyone wishes to hurt them, it is essential for him to thus be killed. 
11:6 These have the authority to lock the heaven, in order that no rainfall may rain <i>on</i> the days of their prophecy and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every <i>kind of</i> wound, whenever they will <i>it</i>.</p>
<p>11:7 And whenever they completed their testimony, the beast which is ascending out of the abyss, will make* war with them and overcome them and kill them. 
11:8 And the corpse<i>s</i> of them <i>lay</i> in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. 
11:9 And <i>some</i> from among the peoples and tribes and languages and nations look upon their corpses three and a half days and do not allow their corpses to be laid in a tomb. {Rev 11:3, 11:11, 12:6, 12:14} 
11:10 And those who are dwelling upon the earth rejoice over them and will be joyous, and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell upon the earth. 
11:11 And after the three and a half days the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon those who view them. {Rev 11:3, 11:9, 12:6, 12:14} 
11:12 And they heard a loud voice out of heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies viewed them. 
11:13 And in that day there became a great earthquake and the tenth <i>part</i> of the city fell, and the names of seven thousand men were killed in the earthquake and the rest became fearful and gave glory to the God of heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>11:14 The second Woe has gone away. Behold, the third Woe is coming shortly.</p>
<br>
<p>11:15 And the seventh messenger sounded, and there became loud voices in heaven saying, The kingdom of the world has become <i>the kingdom</i> of our Lord and of his Christ and he will reign forever and ever.</p>
<p>11:16 And the twenty-four elders, who sit in God’s sight upon their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshiped God, 
11:17 saying, We give-thanks to you, O Lord God, the Almighty, who are and who was, because you have taken your great power and reigned. 
11:18 And the nations were angry and your wrath came and the time of the dead to be judged and <i>the time</i> to give their reward to your bondservants, the prophets, and to the holy-ones, and to those who fear your name, to the little and to the great, and to <i>have</i> decay <i>for</i> those who are corrupting the earth.</p>
<br>
<p>11:19 And the temple of God <i>which is</i> in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant* was seen in his temple, and there became lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail.</p>
<h3>Revelation 12</h3>
<p>12:1 And a great sign was seen in heaven, a woman having been dressed with the sun and the moon underneath her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars; 
12:2 and she was pregnant, and was crying, being in travail and in torment to bear <i>forth</i>. 
12:3 And another sign was seen in heaven and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns and seven diadems upon his heads. 
12:4 And his tail drags the third of the stars of heaven and he cast them to the earth and the dragon is standing in the sight of the woman who is about to bear, in order that whenever she has bore, he may devour her child. 
12:5 And she bore a son, a male <i>child</i>, who is about to shepherd all the nations with* an iron rod and her child was taken away to God and to his throne. 
12:6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that* they may nourish her there <i>one</i> thousand two hundred and sixty days. {Rev 11:3, 11:9, 11:11, 12:14}</p>
<br>
<p>12:7 And there became a war in heaven. Michael and his messengers made war with the dragon, and the dragon and his messengers made war. 
12:8 And they did not prevail, neither was a place found for him anymore in heaven. 
12:9 And the great dragon was cast down, the ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and the Adversary, the one who is misleading the whole inhabited-earth; he was cast down to the earth and his messengers were cast down with him. 
12:10 And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ has become, because the accuser of our brethren has been cast <i>down</i>, who accuses them in the sight of our God day and night. 
12:11 And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love* their life even to death. 
12:12 Because of this, be joyous, O heavens and you* who are dwelling in them. Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the Devil has gone down to you*, having great fury, knowing that he has a small time.</p>
<br>
<p>12:13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who bore the male <i>child.</i> 
12:14 And the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, in order that she may fly into the wilderness to her place, *that she may be nourished there <i>for</i> a time and times and half a time, from the face of the serpent. {Rev 11:3, 11:9, 11:11, 12:6} 
12:15 And the serpent cast water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, that* he might make* the river whisk her away. 
12:16 And the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth. 
12:17 And the dragon was angry against the woman and went away to make* war with the rest of her seed, who are keeping the commandments of God and holding the testimony of Jesus.</p>
<h3>Revelation 13</h3>
<p>13:1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw a beast ascending out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads and upon his horns ten diadems and names of blasphemy upon his heads. 
13:2 And the beast which I saw was similar to a leopard and his feet were like <i>the feet</i> of a bear and his mouth like the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority. 
13:3 And <i>I saw</i> one of his heads, like what has been slaughtered to death, and his deadly wound was healed and the whole earth marveled after the beast; 
13:4 and they worshiped the dragon who has given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, Who is similar to the beast? And who is able to make war with him? 
13:5 And a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies was given to him, and authority to practice war forty-two months was given to him. 
13:6 And he opened his mouth to blaspheme toward God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle, <i>and blaspheme</i> those who are residing in the heaven. 
13:7 And it was given to him to make* a war with the holy-ones and to overcome them and authority over every tribe and people and language and nation was given to him. 
13:8 And all who are dwelling upon the earth will worship him, <i>everyone</i> whose name has not been written from the conception of the world in the Book of Life of the Lamb who has been slaughtered. 
13:9 If anyone has an ear, let him hear. 
13:10 If anyone holds <i>those in</i> captivity, he is going <i>into captivity</i>; if anyone kills with* <i>the</i> sword, it is essential <i>for</i> him to be killed with* <i>the</i> sword. Here is the endurance and the faith of the holy-ones.</p>
<br>
<p>13:11 And I saw another beast ascending out of the earth, and he was holding two horns similar to a lamb and he was speaking like a dragon. 
13:12 And he practiced all the authority of the first beast in his sight and was making* the earth and those who are dwelling in it that* they should worship the first beast, whose wound of death was healed. 
13:13 And he does great signs, even makes* fire in order that it might come down from heaven upon the earth in the sight of men. 
13:14 And the one who is misleading those of mine who are dwelling upon the earth because of the signs which was given to him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to those who dwell upon the earth to make* an image to the beast, who was holding the wound <i>of death</i> from the sword and lived. 
13:15 And it was given to it to give breath to the image, to the beast, that* the image of the beast should speak and <i>that*</i> it should make* as many as would not worship the image of the beast <i>that*</i> they should be killed. 
13:16 And he makes* all, the little and the great, and the rich and the poor. and the free and the bond, in order that there may be marks given to them upon their right hand or upon their foreheads; 
13:17 and that* not anyone may be able to buy or to sell, except he who has the mark, <i>which is</i> the name of the beast or the number of its name. 
13:18 Here is wisdom. He who has perception, let him calculate the number of the beast; for* it is the number of man and his number is six hundred <i>and</i> sixty-six.</p>
<h3>Revelation 14</h3>
<p>14:1 And I saw and behold, the Lamb standing upon the Mount Zion and with him <i>one</i> hundred and forty-four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written upon their foreheads. 
14:2 And I heard a voice from heaven, like the voice of many waters and like the voice of much thunder. And the voice which I heard <i>was</i> like <i>that</i> of harpists harping with* their harps. 
14:3 And they are singing a new song in the sight of the throne and in the sight the four living creatures and the elders and no one was able to learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been bought out of the earth. 
14:4 These are those who were not defiled with women; for* they are virgins. These are those who are following the Lamb wherever he goes. These were bought by Jesus from among men, <i>as</i> the first-fruit to God and to the Lamb. 
14:5 And no lie was found in their mouth. They are unblemished.</p>
<br>
<p>14:6 And I saw a messenger flying in mid-heaven, having <i>the</i> everlasting good-news to proclaim to those who dwell upon the earth and to every nation and tribe and language and people; 
14:7 and he says in a loud voice, Fear the Lord and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come and worship him who made* the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters.</p>
<br>
<p>14:8 And another, a second messenger, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, who has given all the nations to drink out of the wine of the fury of her fornication.</p>
<p>14:9 And another messenger, a third, followed them, saying in a loud voice, If anyone is worshiping the beast and his image and receives a mark upon his forehead or upon his hand, 
14:10 he will also drink out of the wine of the fury of God which has been mingled undiluted in the cup of his wrath, and he will be tormented in fire and brimstone in the sight of the holy messengers and in the sight of the Lamb; 
14:11 and the smoke of their torment is going up forever and ever, and they have no rest day and night, who are worshiping the beast and his image and if anyone receives the mark of his name. 
14:12 Here is the endurance of the holy-ones, those who are keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>14:13 And I heard the voice from heaven saying to me, Write, fortunate are the dead who die in the Lord from now. Yes, says the Spirit, that* they should rest themselves from their labors, and their works follow with them.</p>
<br>
<p>14:14 And I saw and behold, a white cloud, and upon the cloud <i>I saw</i> one sitting similar to a son of man, having upon his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle. 
14:15 And another messenger came out from the temple, crying in a loud voice to him who sat upon the cloud, Send forth your sickle and reap, because the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe. 
14:16 And he who sat upon the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.</p>
<br>
<p>14:17 Another messenger came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. 
14:18 And another messenger came out from the altar, he who has authority over fire, and he shouted to him who had the sharp sickle with a loud outcry, saying, Send forth your sharp sickle and pick the clusters from the earth, because her grape-clusters are prime. 
14:19 And the messenger cast his sickle into the earth and picked <i>the clusters</i> of the vine of the earth and cast it into the winepress, the great <i>winepress</i> of the fury of God. 
14:20 And the winepress was trampled on outside the city and there came out blood from the winepress, even to the bridles of the horses, up to <i>one</i> thousand six hundred furlongs.</p>
<h3>Revelation 15</h3>
<p>15:1 And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven messengers having seven wounds, <i>which are</i> the last, because the fury of God was completed in them.</p>
<br>
<p>15:2 And I saw like a sea of glass having been mingled with fire, and those who are overcoming from the beast and from his image and from the number of his name, standing upon the glassy sea, having harps of God. 
15:3 And they are singing the song of Moses the bondservant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are your works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are your ways, you <i>the</i> King of the nations. 
15:4 Who may never* fear you, Lord, and should glorify your name? Because only you are holy, because all the nations will come and worship in your sight, because your righteousnesses were manifested.</p>
<br>
<p>15:5 And after I saw these things and <i>behold,</i> the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened; 
15:6 and there came out from the temple the seven messengers who had the seven wounds, having clothed themselves with clean bright flax-linen and golden belts having been girded around their chests. 
15:7 And one out of the four living creatures gave to the seven messengers seven golden bowls full of the fury of God, who is living forever and ever. 
15:8 And the temple was filled <i>with</i> smoke from the glory of God and from his power and no one was able to enter into the temple, till the seven wounds of the seven messengers should be completed.</p>
<h3>Revelation 16</h3>
<p>16:1 And I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven messengers, Go and pour out the seven bowls of the fury of God into the earth.</p>
<br>
<p>16:2 And the first went and poured out his bowl into the earth, and it became an evil sore and wicked toward the men who had the mark of the beast and who are worshiping his image.</p>
<br>
<p>16:3 And the second poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like <i>that</i> of a dead man, and every living soul died, <i>and</i> the things that were in the sea.</p>
<br>
<p>16:4 And the third messenger poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of the waters, and it became blood. 
16:5 And I heard the messenger of the waters saying, Righteous are you, who is and who was, you <i>the</i> Holy One, because you judged these things; 
16:6 because they poured out <i>the</i> blood of the holy-ones and the prophets and you gave blood to them to drink for* they are worthy. 
16:7 And I heard from the altar saying, Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments.</p>
<br>
<p>16:8 And the fourth messenger poured out his bowl upon the sun, and it was given to it to burn men in fire. 
16:9 And men were burnt <i>with</i> great heat and the men blasphemed the name of God who has the authority over these wounds, and they did not repent to give him glory.</p>
<br>
<p>16:10 And the fifth messenger poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became darkened, and they were gnawing their tongues out of pain, 
16:11 and they blasphemed the God of heaven out of their pains and out of their sores, and they did not repent from their works.</p>
<br>
<p>16:12 And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, in order that the way of the kings who <i>come</i> from the rising of the sun might be prepared. 
16:13 And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs; 
16:14 for* they are spirits of demons, doing signs; which travel out to the kings of the whole inhabited-earth, to gather them together to the war of that great day of God the Almighty. 
16:15 (Behold, I am coming like a thief. He who is watching and keeping his garments is fortunate, that* he may not walk naked and <i>that*</i> they may see his indecency.) 
16:16 And they gathered them together into the place which in Hebrew is called Har-Magedon.</p>
<br>
<p>16:17 And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air, and there came forth a loud voice from the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It has happened. 
16:18 And there became lightnings and voices and thunders, and there became a great earthquake, such-as has not happened since men have been upon the earth, so-great an earthquake– so great! 
16:19 And the great city became <i>divided</i> into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and Babylon the great was remembered in God’s sight, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath. 
16:20 And every island fled away and the mountains were not found. 
16:21 And great hail, approximately a talant’s poundage {i.e. 58-80 lbs.}, comes down from heaven upon men and men blasphemed God from the wound of the hail, because its wound is extremely great.</p>
<h3>Revelation 17</h3>
<p>17:1 And one out of the seven messengers who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come-here. I will show you the judgment of the large prostitute who is sitting upon many waters; 
17:2 with whom the kings of the earth fornicated and those who are dwelling in the earth were made drunken from the wine of her fornication. 
17:3 And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. 
17:4 And the woman having been dressed in purple and scarlet arrayed with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication of the earth, 
17:5 and a name has been written upon her forehead, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Prostitutes and of the Abominations of the Earth. 
17:6 And I saw the woman drunken from the blood of the holy-ones and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And I marveled when* I saw her– <i>with</i> great marvel! 
17:7 And the messenger said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast which is bearing her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns. 
17:8 The beast which you saw was and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and to go into destruction. And those who are dwelling upon the earth will marvel, those whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the conception of the world, when* they see the beast, how that he was and is not and will be present*.</p>
<p>17:9 Here <i>is</i> the mind that has wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman is sitting; 
17:10 and they are seven kings; the five have fallen, the one is, the other has not yet come, and whenever he comes, it is essential for him to remain a few. 
17:11 And the beast which was and is not, is himself also an eighth and is out of the seven, and he goes into destruction. 
17:12 And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who did not yet receive a kingdom, but they receive authority like kings, with the beast, <i>for</i> one hour. 
17:13 These have one intention and they distribute their power and authority to the beast. 
17:14 These will make war <i>with</i> the Lamb and the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those called and chosen and faithful with him. 
17:15 And he says to me, The waters which you saw, where the prostitute is sitting, are peoples and crowds and nations and languages. 
17:16 And the ten horns which you saw and the beast, these will hate the prostitute and will make her desolate and will make her naked and will eat her flesh and will burn her up in fire. 
17:17 For* God gave to their hearts to do his intention and to do <i>it with</i> one intention and to give their kingdom to the beast, till the words of God should be completed. 
17:18 And the woman whom you saw is the great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.</p>
<br>
<h3>Revelation 18</h3>
<p>18:1 After these things, I saw another messenger coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illuminated from his glory. 
18:2 And he cried in a mighty voice, saying, Babylon the great has fallen and it has become a residence of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit and a prison of every unclean and hated bird. 
18:3 Because out of the wine of the fury of her fornication all the nations have fallen, and the kings of the earth fornicated with her and the merchants of the earth were enriched from the power of her promiscuity.</p>
<br>
<p>18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come forth, my people, out of her, in order that you* might not have fellowship together in her sins and in order that you* might not receive out of her wounds, 
18:5 because her sins were joined <i>to her even</i> up to heaven and God has remembered her wrongdoing. 
18:6 Repay to her as she has also given <i>to you</i>* and you* do this double to her– double <i>again</i> according to her works; in the cup which she mingled, mingle to her double <i>again</i>. 
18:7 Inasmuch as she glorified herself and was promiscuous, give to her so-much <i>more</i> torment and mourning, because she says in her heart, I am sitting <i>as</i> a queen and I am no widow and may never* see mourning. 
18:8 Because of this, in one day her wounds will come– death and mourning and famine. And she will be utterly burned in fire, because strong is the Lord God who judged her. 
18:9 And the kings of the earth, who fornicated and were promiscuous with her, will weep and grieve over her, whenever they look upon the smoke of her fire, 
18:10 standing from afar because of <i>their</i> fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! Because in one hour your judgment has come. 
18:11 And the merchants of the earth will weep and will mourn over her, because no one is buying their cargo anymore; 
18:12 cargo of {F} gold, silver, precious stone, pearl, fine-linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all citron wood, every vessel of ivory, every vessel made out of <i>the</i> most precious wood and from brass, iron and marble; 
18:13 and cinnamon, spice, incenses, perfume, frankincense, wine, oil, fine-flour, grain, sheep, <i>other</i> animals, and of horses and of chariots and of bodies and souls of men. 
18:14 And the autumn-fruits of lust of your soul have gone away from you and all things which were luxurious and bright have perished from you and you may never* find them anymore. 
18:15 The merchants of these things, who were enriched from her, will stand from afar because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning. 
18:16 And <i>they are</i> saying, Woe, woe, the great city, she who has been dressed in fine-linen, and purple and scarlet and has been arrayed in gold, precious stone and pearls! 
18:17 Because in an hour so-many riches was made desolate. And every helmsman and everyone who sails any place and sailors and as many as are working from the sea, stood from afar, 
18:18 and were crying out, seeing the smoke of her fire, saying, What <i>city</i> is similar to the great city? 
18:19 And they cast dirt upon their heads and were crying, weeping and mourning and saying, Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had their ships in the sea were enriched out of her costliness! Because in one hour she was made desolate. 
18:20 <i>O</i> heaven be joyous over her and <i>you</i>* holy-ones and <i>you</i>* apostles and <i>you</i>* prophets, because God has judged your* judgment on {Greek: out of. Or: from.} her.</p>
<br>
<p>18:21 And a strong messenger took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, So Babylon, the great city, will be cast down, with a violent-impulse, and may never* be found anymore. 
18:22 And the voice of harpists and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters may never* be heard in you anymore, and no craftsman, of whatever craft, may never* be found in you anymore, and the voice of a millstone may never* be heard in you anymore; 
18:23 and the light of a lamp may never* appear in you anymore, and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride may never* be heard in you anymore. Your merchants were the great-men of the earth, because all the nations were misled in your sorcery. 
18:24 And in her, the bloods of prophets and of holy-ones and of all who have been slaughtered upon the earth was found.</p>
<br>
<p>{Footnotes: Re 18:12,13, in the list of merchandise ‘and’ was removed between many of the words and replaced with a comma.}</p>
<h3>Revelation 19</h3>
<p>19:1 After these things, I heard as <i>it was</i> a large voice of a large crowd in heaven, saying, Hallelujah! Salvation and power and glory, <i>is</i> from our God: 
19:2 because true and righteous <i>are</i> his judgments, because he has judged the great prostitute, she who was corrupting the earth in her fornication and he has avenged the blood of his bondservants from her hand.</p>
<p>19:3 And they have said a second-time, Hallelujah. And her smoke goes up forever and ever.</p>
<p>19:4 And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is sitting upon the throne, saying, Amen. Hallelujah.</p>
<p>19:5 And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all his bondservants, and those who fear him, the little and the great.</p>
<p>19:6 And I heard as <i>it was</i> the voice of a large crowd and like the voice of many waters and like the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah, because the Lord our God, the Almighty reigns. 
19:7 We should rejoice and should be glad and should give the glory to him, because the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has prepared herself. 
19:8 And it was given to her that* she might dress herself in fine-linen, bright and clean; for* the fine-linen is the righteousnesses of the holy-ones.</p>
<p>19:9 And he says to me, Write, those who have been invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb are fortunate. And he says to me, These are true words of God. 
19:10 And I fell down before his feet to worship him. And he says to me, See that <i>you do</i> not <i>do that</i>. I am a fellow bondservant of you and of your brethren who are holding the testimony of Jesus. Worship God; for* the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</p>
<br>
<p>19:11 And I saw the heaven has been opened, and behold, a white horse and he who sat upon it being called Faithful and True, and he is judging in righteousness and is making war. 
19:12 Now his eyes <i>are</i> a flame of fire and upon his head <i>are</i> many diadems, and he has names written which no one knows except he himself. 
19:13 And he has been dressed in a garment, having been dipped in blood and his name is called The Word of God. 
19:14 And the armies which are in heaven were following him upon white horses, having clothed themselves in fine-linen, white <i>and</i> clean. 
19:15 And a sharp two edged sword travels out from his mouth, in order that he might strike the nations with* it and he will shepherd them with* an iron rod and he tramples on the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God, the Almighty. 
19:16 And he has upon his garment and upon his thigh a name has been written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</p>
<br>
<p>19:17 And I saw a messenger standing in the sun, and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come-here. Be gathered together to the great supper of God; 
19:18 in order that you* may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit upon them and the flesh of all men, both free <i>men</i> and bondservants and both <i>the</i> little and <i>the</i> great.</p>
<br>
<p>19:19 And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies, have been gathered together to make* a war with him who sat upon the horse and with his army. 
19:20 And the beast was clutched and with him the false prophet who made* the signs in his sight, in which he misled those who <i>had</i> received the mark of the beast and those who are worshiping his image. The two were cast <i>while</i> living into the lake of fire which is burning in brimstone. 
19:21 And the rest were killed with* the sword of him who sat upon the horse, which came forth out of his mouth and all the birds were fed from their flesh.</p>
<h3>Revelation 20</h3>
<p>20:1 And I saw a messenger coming down from heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. 
20:2 And he took-hold of the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the Devil and the Adversary, the one who is misleading the whole world and bound him a thousand years, 
20:3 and cast him into the abyss and lock <i>it</i> and sealed <i>it</i> above him, in order that he may not mislead the nations anymore, till the thousand years might be completed. It is essential <i>for</i> him to be loosed <i>for</i> a little time after these things.</p>
<br>
<p>20:4 And I saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given to them and <i>I saw</i> the souls of those who had been decapitated because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God and those who did not worship the beast, nor his image and did not receive the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand, and they lived and reigned with Christ the thousand years. 
20:5 But the rest of the dead did not live till the thousand years might be completed. This is the first resurrection. 
20:6 Fortunate and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him a thousand years. {Rev 1:6, 5:10}</p>
<br>
<p>20:7 And whenever the thousand years might be completed, the Adversary will be loosed out of his prison, 
20:8 and will go out to mislead the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together into the war. The number of whom is like the sand of the sea. 
20:9 And they went up over the width of the earth and surrounded the encampment of the holy-ones and the beloved city and fire from God came down out of heaven and devoured them. 
20:10 And the Devil who is misleading them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</p>
<br>
<p>20:11 And I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. 
20:12 And I saw the dead, the greatest and the least, standing in the sight of the throne, and books were opened and another book was opened, which is <i>the</i> Book of Life and the dead were judged out of the things which have been written in the books, according to their works. 
20:13 And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them and they were judged each one according to their works. 
20:14 And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, <i>which is</i> the lake of fire. 
20:15 And if anyone was not found, having been written in the Book of Life, he was cast into the lake of fire.</p>
<h3>Revelation 21</h3>
<p>21:1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for* the first heaven and the first earth have passed away, and the sea is no more. 
21:2 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from heaven of God, having been prepared as a bride adorned for* her husband. 
21:3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men and he will reside with them and they will be his people and God himself will be with them <i>and will be</i> their God. 
21:4 And he will wipe-away every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more; neither will there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, anymore. The first things have passed away.</p>
<p>21:5 And he who is sitting upon the throne said, <b>Behold, I am making* all things new.</b> And he says to me, <b>Write, because these words are faithful and true.</b> 
21:6 And he said to me, <b>I have become <i>new</i>. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give freely to him who is thirsty out of the spring of the water of life.</b> 
21:7 <b>He who is overcoming will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be my son.</b> 
21:8 <b>But <i>to</i> the cowardly and unbelieving and sinners and detestable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and to all the false <i>witnesses</i>, their <i>part will be</i> in the lake which is burning with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.</b></p>
<br>
<p>21:9 And one out of the seven messengers who had the seven bowls full of the last seven wounds came and spoke with me, saying, Come-here. I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb. 
21:10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a mountain great and high and showed me the great holy city Jerusalem, coming down from heaven from God, 
21:11 having the glory of God. Her illumination was similar to a precious stone, like a crystal-like jasper stone; 
21:12 having a great and high wall; having twelve gates and upon the gates twelve messengers, and names have been written <i>on them</i>, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. 
21:13 Three gates were on the east and three gates were on the north, and three gates were on the south, and three gates were on the west. 
21:14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 
21:15 And he, speaking with me, was holding a measure, a golden reed, in order that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall. 
21:16 And the city lays four cornered and the length <i>is</i> as the width and he measured the city with the reed in furlongs, {F} twelve thousand <i>and</i> twelve <i>furlongs</i>, the length and the width and its height are equal. 
21:17 And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, <i>according to</i> the measure of a man, which is, of a messenger. 
21:18 And the structure of its wall was jasper and the city was purest gold, similar to purest glass. 
21:19 The foundations of the wall of the city have been adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; 
21:20 the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, carnelian; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. 
21:21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was from one pearl, respectively and the street of the city was purest gold like transparent glass. 
21:22 And I saw no temple in it; for* the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb, are its temple. 
21:23 And the city has no need of the sun, neither of the moon, that* they should appear in it; for* the glory of God illuminated it and its lamp <i>is</i> the Lamb. 
21:24 And the nations will walk in its light and the kings of the earth bring their glory and the honor of the nations into it. 
21:25 And its gates may never* be locked by day (for* there will be no night there). 
21:26 And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it. 
21:27 And any desecrated thing may never* enter into it or <i>anything</i> practicing an abomination and a lie; except those who have been written in the Lamb’s Book of Life.</p>

<h3>Revelation 22</h3>
<p>22:1 And he showed me a river of <i>the</i> clean water of life, bright like crystal, traveling out from the throne of God and of the Lamb, 
22:2 in the middle of its street. And the Tree of Life was on this side and on that side of the river, producing twelve fruits, giving its fruit monthly and the leaves of the tree were *for the healing of the nations. 
22:3 And there will be no curse there and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it. And his bondservants will give-divine service to him; 
22:4 and they will see his face, and his name <i>will be</i> upon their foreheads. 
22:5 And there will be no night there, and they do not need a lamp or a light, because the Lord God will illuminate them and they will reign forever and ever.</p>
<br>
<p>22:6 And he says to me, These words are faithful and true and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his messengers to show to his bondservants what things are essential to happen shortly.</p>
<p>22:7 <b>And behold, I am coming shortly. He who is keeping the words of the prophecy of this book is fortunate.</b></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>22:8 And I, John, am he who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the messenger who shows me these things. 
22:9 And he says to me, See that <i>you do</i> not <i>do that</i>. I am a fellow bondservant of you and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who are keeping the words of this book. Worship God.</p>
<br>
<p>22:10 And he says to me, Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, because the time is near. 
22:11 He who is doing wrong, let him still do wrong and he who <i>is</i> filthy, let him still be filthy and the <i>one who is</i>  just, let him still be justified and the <i>one who is</i> holy, let him still be holy.</p>
<p>22:12 <b>Behold, I am coming shortly, and my reward <i>is</i> with me, to give to each <i>one</i> as his work will be.</b> 
22:13 <b>I <i>am</i> the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.</b></p>
<p>22:14 Those who are practicing his commandments <i>are</i> fortunate, that* their authority will be in the Tree of Life and they may enter in by the gates into the city. 
22:15 Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the fornicators and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices a lie.</p>
<br>
<p>22:16 <b>I, Jesus, have sent my messenger to testify to you* these things in the congregations*. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright, the morning star.</b></p>
<br>
<p>22:17 And the Spirit and the bride say, <b>Come. And he who hears, let him say, Come. And he who is thirsty, let him come. He who wills, let him take the water of life freely.</b></p>
<br>
<p>22:18 I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, if anyone should add to them, God might add to him the wounds which have been written in this book. {Deu 4:2?} 
22:19 And if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God takes away his part from the Tree of Life and out of the holy city, which have been written in this book.</p>
<br>
<p>22:20 He who is testifying of these things says, <b>Yes, I am coming shortly. Amen</b>.</p>
<br>
<p>Yes come, Lord Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>22:21 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with all the holy-ones. Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>{End of the Holy New Covenant: Modern Literal Version. To God is the glory. Amen}</p>
