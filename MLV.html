<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">Two distinct and opposite techniques are used in translating the New Testament from the Greek. The Modern Literal
Version is the first type, a &#8216;literal&#8217; translation sometimes called &#8216;word-for-word&#8217; translation. The second, and most
common in the past 30 years, is to paraphrase the Greek into English. The latter type of translation is known by various
names such as: dynamic equivalence, free style, thought-for-thought, better than a word-for-word, essentially literal and
so on. We understand the value of paraphrases for those looking for a Bible that reads as easily as a newspaper, however
we feel strongly about having a Bible without opinions, and instead faithfully reproducing the original Greek Bible into
Modern English. One way to look at it is like this: if there was a court case with a particular document that was being
used as evidence, and this document was in a foreign language, would a &#8216;thought-for-thought&#8217; translation be acceptable?
The &#8216;document&#8217; we are talking about here is the &#8216;Last Will and Testament&#8217; of our Lord Jesus and Savior. The goal of
everyone who has worked on the Modern Literal Version has been to keep any form of commentary or paraphrase out
of the translation as is humanly possible. The MLV is not sold for profit because there is no denomination, publishing
company, foundation or government behind it. All Christian groups have had the opportunity to propose fixes for the
MLV or to assist in some way. The only uninspired traditions kept in the MLV are: punctuation and capitalization;
chapter and verse numbers; and book order.</span></span></p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">The &#8216;Modern Literal Version New Testament&#8217; came about in 1987 due to a young Christian&#8217;s goal to find an accurate
Modern English translation from which to study. The New American Standard contradicted itself in Matthew 5:17 and
Ephesians 2:15 for example. Almost all other Modern English translations do not claim to be literal or word-for-word
and most that make such a claim are factually not. Concordance look-ups in all existing translations present non-uniform
Greek word renderings and this too was an issue of concern.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">A Bible Study Group, of which this new Christian was a part, was actively doing topical, <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">English and Greek word studies
with their Bibles and &#8216;Englishman&#8217;s Greek Concordances.&#8217; They discovered that the ASV was the most accurate
translation, and initially started a study Bible cross reference section for it. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Then an idea developed to do a computerized
revision of the 1901 American Standard Version for the public domain, code named &#8216;ASV3'. Eventually, these ideas were
dropped due to too many problems: the underlying Greek text, massive footnoting, archaic words, inconsistent Greek
word translations, etc. A better idea grew, the creation of a modern (English) literal version (which later became its
name). A group of workers, computer owners and scholars, who believe in the total authority and inspiration of the Bible,
devoted time, advice, software, money and work to the project. Now, over 28 years later, at least 62 experts in the
original language have contributed work needed to make this translation a reality. Many others, about 250, have also
helped with large amounts of proofreading, improvements to English comprehension, double-checking Greek definitions,
compounds, synonyms, Greek concordance look-ups, accuracy checks and/or other menial (but extremely essential)
tasks. A few thousand corrections have been received via E-mail for changes, so far. We will never be able to express
our gratitude enough to all of these people, living and deceased.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The MLV was the first translation to use the power of the computer (an 8086), and would have been impossible before
the computer age. This translation would have been impossible without WordPerfect (special thanks to Corel
Corporation).</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif">The original intentions and guidelines for the Modern Literal Version</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"></span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">1. To translate the original Greek of the Bible, word-for-word, into English, then to further boost the accuracy of the
MLV, we translate the same Greek word into as few different English words as is possible. We also do this for English
words by not using the same English word for different Greek words. Careful attention was paid to synonyms, antonyms,
compound words and the few Greek words which truly have multiple meanings. One way to look at this is: if God
wanted 10 different words used instead of one single Greek word, the inspired writers would have penned it that way.
The New Testament is its own best commentary when you see the same Greek word translated into the same English
word throughout. We call this &#8216;uniform and consistent&#8217; translating and we believe that we&#8217;re the first translation to ever
attempt this. This form of translation is an extremely challenging task, and not one that many translators would ever take
the time to do, even though it is now possible to do with computers. More information is in the &#8216;Wording Statistics&#8217;
section at the end of the 8.5'x11' or on the web site or in e-Sword.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">2. The goal of the MLV was not to make it perfect everyday English, but to try to make it understandable to the majority
of English speaking people, while remaining literal. Many sentences in the MLV start with conjunctions like &#8216;and,&#8217; &#8216;but,&#8217;
&#8216;for&#8217; and &#8216;because.&#8217; This was so that we could split incredibly long sentences, some of which were more than 50 words
in length, into shorter ones as we were translating the text into English. The Modern Literal Version</span> is at about a 13 year
old&#8217;s reading level<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">3. To translate some verses that have been misinterpreted for years by many religious groups, as close as possible to the
original language.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">4. To use <i>italics </i>for supplied words and use supplied words as opposed to paraphrasing. We want people to see what we
added.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">5. To translate the money and measuring systems of the Bible into some understandable form.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">6. To use &#8216;will&#8217; for all future tenses. Though it is not proper Modern English. It is the way most English people speak.
However, &#8216;shall&#8217; is retained in questions.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">7. To use paragraph format. Verse format often take meanings out of context or contributes toward misinterpretations
of the context.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">8. To use the more proper &#8216;may&#8217; or &#8216;might&#8217; for the subjunctive mood verbs. The ASV used &#8216;should&#8217; and &#8216;shall.&#8217; Shall
is not consider &#8216;conditional&#8217; in Modern English, but future tense. (See more in the &#8216;<span style="font-weight: bold">Verb, Tenses, Moods</span>&#8217; section).</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">9. To arrange the Greek word order into normal English word order of subject verb object, (SVO). Following Greek word
order is not more literal or accurate; if we retained the Greek order it would just be more like an interlinear without the
Greek.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">10. To footnote or explain in the &#8216;<span style="font-weight: bold">Definitions</span>&#8217; section places where a literal translation could not be understood or an
idiom used by the common Greeks. For example: &#8216;into/to the ages&#8217; is an idiom for &#8216;forever.&#8217; (These are not as common
as many people would have you believe).</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">11. To render active tense verbs as &#8216;is/are verb-ing&#8217; to help show action. Many people wrongly say the &#8216;-eth&#8217; ending used
in older translations meant continual action. It was simply the way they spoke before the 1800's.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">12. To fix the preposition and conjunction problems that plague all translations. Our biggest fix is the English word &#8216;for&#8217;
that was used even in the ASV for several Greek words which mean &#8216;because of,&#8217; &#8216;because,&#8217; &#8216;to,&#8217; &#8216; toward,&#8217; &#8216;of,&#8217; &#8216;in/on
behalf of&#8217; and a mild form of &#8216;because.&#8217; The MLV translated all Greek words that mean &#8216;because,&#8217; &#8216;because of&#8217; and
&#8216;in/on behalf of&#8217; as such. The other meanings are shown by use of asterisks (*) with the two most common Greek words
translated as &#8216;for&#8217; (&#8216;eis,' G1520 = *for and G1063 &#8216;gar&#8217; = for*).</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">13. </span>To avoid inconsistencies caused by splitting up the translators and proofreaders into groups. A typical translation
may have 100 plus people but by the time you split them into 25 or more committees the number of people in one
particular book might be as little as 4 and those different groups can cause stylistic and translation variations. Those who
volunteer with the MLV tend to work all the way through the New Testament, so in the MLV the total per book far
exceeds any committee type translation.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">14. To include a Harmony of the New Testament with AD dates, which gives a person the ability to read the New
Testament straight through or in chronological order. (Start at Mark, then go to Acts: The Book of Conversions.)</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">15. When traditional rendering are not Greek, they will be translated properly. Oh well the theologians will just have
to adjust; (added in 2013 because we found us also following tradition).</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">16. Translate words using their full translation even if a little too wordy in places to denote differences between English
wording used for different Greek wording. Two examples are: &#8216;together with&#8217; vs. &#8216;with&#8217; (G4862 &amp; its compounds); &#8216;go-onward&#8217; vs. &#8216;go&#8217; (G4198 and its compounds).</span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">The 1987-1999 version, at roughly 95% completed, was formally U.S. copyrighted and placed into the &#8216;Christian

possible while retaining modern language and readability. The &#8216;Open Source&#8217; approach is also a great &#8216;checks and

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000">The MLV is NOT under the control of any denomination or publishing company or government and is not the current

the English translation does not lend itself to a satisfactory meaning of the underlying Greek word. In addition to this,
we use an asterisk to denote the difference between one English word that is being used for two different Greek words
(for example, see <span style="font-weight: bold">Age*</span> below.) This substantially aids word studies.</span></span></span></p>

needed to help show action, tense or expansion of the meaning of words that the English does not convey. Since the
MLV is literal, not &#8216;thought-for-thought,' supplied words are of significant assistance for those phrases which are
exceptionally difficult to read. By pointing out these words using italics the reader has the option to disregard them. The
articles &#8216;a&#8217; and &#8216;an&#8217; are not found in the Greek and as such, are always supplied though never marked.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"></span></span></span></p>

mind. Read God&#8217;s Word like a child would for the first time, never read it with preconceived ideas or thoughts or to
prove something, and don&#8217;t try to understand everything, note what you don&#8217;t understand and move on; reread those
notes later they may make sense. Remember to pray. </span></span><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The arrangement is for better understanding by letting books build
on each other and are arranged in a rough chronological order. Use Sundays to catch up on days you could not spend
20 minutes with the Word of God. If you have never read the Bible, always start with the New Testament. The New
Testament is what you will be judged by, not the Old Testament.<span style="font-weight: bold"> Never read the Old Testament &amp; New Testament
together</span>, that is too confusing even for the mature Christian.</span></span></span></p>

translation.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The first four books of the New Testament are traditionally called the <i>gospels</i>, a word which means &#8216;good news.&#8217; These
are basically four biographies of Jesus Christ, written to share the good news about His life, death, and resurrection. Each
of these four <i>gospels</i> was written to a different audience, and so each one has a slightly different approach&#8212;but they
are all accurate biographies of Jesus Christ. Matthew wrote his <i>gospel</i> to a Jewish audience, and so he included several
quotations from the Old Testament, showing that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah they had been waiting for. Mark
wrote to a Roman audience, which liked their reading to be more action-oriented, so his account focuses more on the
actions of Jesus. Luke wrote to a more detail-oriented audience, and his account is filled with historical and geographical
details that weren&#8217;t included by the other writers. John wrote to a general audience, guiding them to faith in Jesus as the
Son of God.</span></span></span></p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The book of Matthew is better called &#8220;The Gospel Account by Matthew.&#8221; This biography of Jesus the Christ was written
primarily for Jews, which is why Matthew spent so much time showing how Jesus fulfilled Old Testament
prophecies&#8212;things that would have been irrelevant to a non-Jewish audience. Beginning with the birth of Jesus,
Matthew recounts how Jesus lived a perfect life under the Law of Moses, and how His death would set the stage for a
New Testament under which men could be saved. The final instructions given by Jesus after His resurrection, in this
biography, are on how disciples are made: by teaching and immersing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit (Matthew 28:18-20).</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Introduction to Mark</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The book of Mark, more accurately titled &#8220;The Gospel Account by Mark,&#8221; was written to a Roman audience. The
Romans were not interested in lots of extra details, nor were they too concerned about prophecies contained in Jewish
writings from hundreds of years earlier (Mark only quotes three Old Testament prophecies). The events in Mark are held
by scholars to be in chronological order. Starting from His baptism (immersion), Mark portrays Jesus as a Man constantly
on the move for God, with the word &#8220;immediately&#8221; appearing 42 times in this, the shortest of the Gospel accounts.
Percentage-wise, Mark spends more time dealing with the final week of Jesus&#8217; life than any of the other Gospel writers.
The final instructions given by Jesus after His resurrection, in this biography, are to &#8220;preach the good-news to the whole
creation. He who believes and is immersed will be saved, but he who disbelieves will be condemned&#8221; (Mark 16:15-16).</span></span></span></p>

This doctor was very specific when
describing <i>when</i> things took place, as well as <i>where</i>. As such, Luke is the most detail-oriented of the four Gospel
Accounts. Beginning with the miraculous birth of Jesus&#8217; cousin John, and Jesus&#8217; own birth six months later, Luke reveals
the life of Jesus in chronological order. It is in this biography of Jesus that we see Jesus foretelling the completion of
the Old Testament in the lifetime of the people to whom He spoke (Luke 20:21-22). Jesus&#8217; final instructions to His
apostles, after His resurrection, were &#8220;Repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in <i>My</i> name to all the
nations, beginning from Jerusalem&#8221; (Luke 24:47).</span></span></span></p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The Gospel Account by John was most likely written after the other three, and fills in some gaps that were not covered
by Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins His biography of Jesus by starting at the very creation of the world, showing
Jesus as &#8220;The Word&#8221; which was &#8220;God&#8221; and &#8220;became flesh and resided among us&#8221; (John 1:1-3, 14). From there, the focus
is on showing the life, teac</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">hings, and miracles of Jesus in such a way that the reader might &#8220;believe that
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, <i>the reader</i> may have life in His name&#8221; (John
20:30-31). Among other things, it is in this Gospel Account that we learn that Jesus rejected the idea
of setting up an earthly kingdom (John 6:15, 18:36).</span></span></p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The book of Acts, or the <i>Book of Conversions</i>, is a history of the establishment of various
congregations</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"> and the expansion of Christianity. It is actually a continuation of the gospel of Luke,
written by the same author to the same audience. A good outline for the whole book is given by
Jesus in 1:8: &#8216;you will be witnesses to me, both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to
the outermost parts of the earth.&#8217; In this book are the only examples in the entire New Testament of
how people were saved from their sins following the death of Jesus Christ. In fact, the question,
&#8216;what shall we do?&#8217; is asked and answered multiple times in this book. The Jews (Acts 2), the
Samaritans (Acts 8),  the Gentiles (Acts 10), the Philippian jailer (Acts 16), and Saul were taught
about Jesus Christ, and salvation was offered to them all in the same way. Saul, (later, apostle Paul),
even though called from heaven, was even told what he must do, (Act 9, 16, 22). The last half of the
book focuses mainly on the travels of the apostle Paul, who went throughout the Roman Empire
teaching people what to do to be saved.  During his travels, many of the New Testament letters were
written to various congregations. </span></span></p>

worshiping.</span></span></p>

not to give himself to the theater <i>crowd</i>. <sup>19:32</sup> Therefore some were crying one thing and some
another; for<sup>*</sup> the assembly was confused, and most did not know why they had come together. <sup>19:33</sup>

Alexander, having beckoned <i>with</i> the hand, was wishing to make a defense to the public. <sup>19:34</sup> But

concerning today&#8217;s riot, no cause exists<i> for it</i> and concerning it, we will not be able to give account
of this conspiracy. <sup>19:41</sup> And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</span></span></p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The remainder of the New Testament is a collection of letters written <i>to Christians</i>, helping them
to know how to live their lives for Jesus Christ after they were saved from their sins. Each one deals
with specific issues and problems that different groups of Christians were struggling with. The first
nine letters are written by the apostle Paul to specific congregations of the Lord&#8217;s body in various
cities, and are named for the area in which those Christians lived. The next four letters are written
by Paul to specific Christian individuals who were working with congregations. The letter to the
Hebrews was written to help Jewish Christians understand that the Old Testament had fulfilled its
purpose in pointing people to something much better: Jesus Christ. The letters of James, 1 and 2
Peter, 1, 2, and 3 John, and Jude were all written to Christians in various areas, and the letters are
named after the writer. The book of Revelation is a combination of letters from Jesus Christ to
specific congregations, and a prophecy given as a reminder to Christians to stay faithful even in
persecution, because God is the one ultimately in control.</span></p>

I was stoned once. I was shipwrecked three-times. I have spent a night and a day in the depth <i>of the

by false brethren; <sup>11:27</sup> in labor and hardship, often in sleeplessness, in famine and thirst, often in
fasts, in cold and nakedness. <sup>11:28</sup> Plus <i>there are</i> those things which are outside, my daily pressure
<i>which is my</i> anxiety for all the congregations<sup>*</sup>. <sup>11:29</sup> Who is weak and I am not weak? Who is
offended and I am not on fire? <sup>11:30</sup> If it is essential <i>for me</i> to be boasting, I will boast <i>in</i> the things
which <i>are</i> from my weakness. <sup>11:31</sup> The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is gracious<sup>*</sup>
forever, knows that I am not lying. <sup>11:32</sup> In Damascus the Ethnarch of Aretas, the king, was guarding
the Damascenes&#8217; city, wishing to arrest me; <sup>11:33</sup> and I was lowered through a window in a hamper

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">One of the best ways to describe the Modern Literal Version New Testament translation is that it is the <i>first</i> to adopt
many significant translation principles:</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">1. It was the <i>first</i> translation to use the power of modern computers. All the way back in 1987.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">2. The MLV was the <i>first</i> to attempt to keep Greek uniformity. (Same Greek word translation into the same English
word(s) whenever possible, same with phrases and idioms.)</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">3. The MLV was the <i>first</i> and <i>only</i> to attempt to keep English uniformity. In other words keeping one specific English
word to represent only one specific Greek word or one of its meanings. The worst example probably is the word &#8216;<i>will</i>&#8217;
which is the translation of 69 different Greek words in the King James Version. Please note though, that some related
Greek words from the same root will share English words. If God had intended the New Testament to be written in
10,000 different words, he would have written it that way.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">4. The <i>first</i> translation that has no contradictions. The MLV began its journey because of the Mt 5:17 (abolish) vs. Eph
2:15 (abolish) one found in most modern translations; same English word used for 2 different Greek words. Jesus came
to not tear down the old law but to fulfill it (5:17-18), and then abolished it with his death on the cross, thereby
implementing the &#8216;New Covenant&#8217; (Eph 2:12-16).</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">5. The MLV was the <i>first</i> Bible translation to be open on the internet for anyone to submit corrections, updates or help,
since 1998 and the <i>only </i>published translation to stay open with yearly and web updates.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">6. The MLV is the <i>first</i> to be done by a group of people not divided among committees which instantly creates
inconsistent translations. This means some books in the MLV may have had 40 or more people look over them for Greek
or English problems. No other translation has had this kind of manpower devoted to it!</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">7. The MLV is the <i>first </i>and <i>only</i> translation to ever deal with the word &#8216;for,' by translating all the &#8216;for&#8217; conjunctions as
&#8216;because.&#8217;</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">8. The MLV is the first to denote when there is an update. Almost all other translations make changes and the name
remains the same.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">9. The MLV is the only bible translation to ever create books (e-Sword module, too) that can be used to correct or verify
the MLV.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Other uncommon translation principles that sets the MLV apart:</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">A. You* (plural) vs. You (singular). Many insights are lost because there is no way to know who is being addressed, a
crowd or an individual.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">B. The &#8216;Checks &amp; balance system&#8217; of being an &#8216;Open Source&#8217; translation with the possibility of over a million people
watching has kept the MLV pure from denominational or theological slants. No one has ever submitted &#8216;indoctrinations&#8217;
because they know the next person will just take them out.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">C. 12-13 year old reading level.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">D. All wording is in Modern English, each word can be looked up at dictionary.com or in a regular dictionary and you
have a &#8216;Bible Correct&#8217; meaning.  For example, &#8216;mediator&#8217; in Modern English is an &#8216;arbitrator&#8217; a person who works out
compromises; if there is an attribute of God, compromise is not it!</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">E. You have the ability to read the New Testament in chronological order; start in Mark and continue, or in a similar
fashion by following the enclosed &#8216;Reading Schedule.&#8217;</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">F. The MLV translates the transliterated words which still plague translations by being repeated over and over because
of tradition, for example &#8216;Satan&#8217; is &#8216;The Adversary&#8217; and &#8216;angel&#8217; is now &#8216;messenger&#8217; (a serious issue because people
didn&#8217;t know &#8216;messenger&#8217; and &#8216;angel&#8217; are from the same Greek word), etc.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">G. This is probably the best translation anyone could use if studying Greek, because of its uniformity.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">H. The MLV is literal (word-for-word) translation; other translation styles primarily</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"> use paraphrase. </span>Literal is &#8216;God says&#8217;
and paraphrase is &#8216;The translators interprets what God said for you.&#8217;<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I. The MLV has gone to extremes to better translate verb moods, tenses and cases than any other common Bible
translation. Most do a pitiful job of showing the action conveyed in Greek present indicative and imperfects verbs.</span></span></span></p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Subjunctive Mood</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"> verbs &#8216;<i>usually state a thing as conditional, possible (but not accomplished) or something merely
entertained as a thought. It may be a statement viewed emotionally, as desired, doubted, or wished.</i>&#8217; (Roberts Grammar,
pg. 130.) Subjunctive mood verbs have always been a problem in translations in the past 600 years and have plagued
the MLV as well. These verbs are denoted by the words &#8216;should, may or might&#8217; and are added in front of them. These
subjunctive mood verbs in Greek are most often preceded by a &#8216;conditional particle&#8217; or some other part of speech (see
G302, G1437, G1437a, G1875, G2579, G3752). These conditional statements, when translated into English, begin with
words like &#8216;if, whoever, whatever, whenever, lest&#8217; and the &#8216;should, may or might&#8217; is usually dropped, (too wordy and
confusing for Modern English). Some of these conditional statements are denoted at the beginning with &#8216;*that&#8217; (G3705),
&#8216;that*&#8217; or &#8216;in order that&#8217;(G2443). We have translated all of these, as in Mark 4:27, for the sake of remaining as literal
as possible, even though Modern English would abbreviate the sentence down to the first &#8216;should.&#8217;</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In Greek translation places where subjunctive mood verbs occur with G3661 are generally changed to imperative mood
(determined by context). An example is the ending of Mark 5:7 where the demon is speaking to Jesus and saying: &#8216;Do
not torment me&#8217; whereas the subjunctive mood would be meaningless: &#8216;You may not torment me.&#8217; Even though a
conditional statement does carry a future tense feeling, the improper use of &#8216;shall&#8217; and &#8216;will&#8217; was dropped. (&#8216;Shall&#8217; is
Old English present tense of &#8216;should&#8217; as well as first person future tense; a current 13 year old has no idea about &#8216;shall&#8217;
meaning &#8216;should.&#8217;) Even though, &#8216;may never&#8217; and &#8216;should we give?&#8217; might sound better as &#8216;will never&#8217; or &#8216;shall we
give?&#8217; we opted to keep subjunctive mood as such as opposed to making them future tense. &#8216;Will&#8217; in modern language,
even though &#8216;it has not happened,&#8217; is frequently thought of as</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"> &#8216;is absolutely going to take place,&#8217; which would be
incorrect in almost all places. The inspired writers could have use future tense if that was what they meant.</span></span></span></p>

way to deliver the Word of God than trying to teach English. We pray that Christians from countries would create their
own translation, using the original Greek Majority Text and the same translation principles we used in the MLV.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In the first century, the entire known world was under Roman rule and the universal language was Koine Greek (common
Greek). The language became dead two centuries later (nevermore to change). Even though many have tried to make
the Greek language &#8216;change&#8217; with new theologies, only translation principles have changed. For example, Koine Greek
was not even known to be a separate language from Greek until the late 1800's.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The New Testament makes mention of three different rulers of Judea under Greek authority named Herod. Herod the
Great reigned from 39 BC to 4 BC. He expanded the Temple to include the royal family&#8217;s wing. His son Herod
Archelaus reigned from 4 BC to 6 AD. Augustus judged him incompetent and reorganized the territories under the other
son, Herod Antipas from 4 BC to 39 AD.</span></span></span></p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The soldiers of the Roman military were also the police. If a guard lost his prisoner(s), he and his family were forfeited
in exchange; that is why many guards committed suicide. By committing suicide, their families would be spared. The
jailer in Acts 16 was about to do this before Paul shouted to him.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"></span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Part of a day, to the Jews, equaled an entire day and night. In modern terms, the Bible indicates that Jesus said he will
be in the tomb three days and three nights (Mt 12:40), but this is by Jewish thinking or custom. Jesus was buried Friday
(Day of Preparation; Day 1). He was in the tomb from 6:00 PM Friday to 6:00 PM Saturday (The Sabbath; Day 2). He
arose sometime around dawn Sunday (the first day of the week; Day 3). The &#8216;ninth hour&#8217; in those days is 3:00 PM in

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Women and bondservants under Roman rule had the same rights in court. A widow or single woman without close male
family was an easy target by just about anyone who wanted to take advantage of her (James 1:27). Lydia and her group,
in order to stay safe, probably maintained a circle of protection in Acts 16.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In order to highlight some of the issues we have found with translation accuracy in various Bibles, we have compiled
a chart that compares the amount of English words translated from the Greek words. By using a random number
generator, we have picked some of the Strong&#8217;s numbers between 1 and 5624 and added G1096 which is the most
troublesome Greek verb we know. Unlike the Theologians who like comparing by their believes or motives, this is
pure Math, without opinions. We hope this will illustrate our faithfulness to our own guidelines in making the MLV
as accurate as possible:</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><i><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">1. To translate the original language, word-for-word into English. Then to further boost the accuracy of the MLV, to
translate the same Greek word into as few different English words as possible. We also do this for English words by
not using them for different Greek words...</span></i></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Specifically, we compare the MLV to the KJV and the NASB, later the NKJV and ESV were added. This is simply
because they are the only Bibles that have an easily accessible English to Greek Lexicon and a Greek to English
concordance that we need to compile this chart, <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> because they are &#8216;the most&#8217; inaccurate. We have now a similar
concordance for the MLV in book form. This concordance with Greek addition is available in e-Sword or as &#8216;The
New Koine Greek Textbook I &amp; II&#8217; on amazon.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Modern Bibles claim to be accurate, but most do not even italicize, or otherwise highlight, <i>supplied words</i>. These are
words that are not in the Greek, but are implied by context. The reader should be able to decide whether or not to
include the words of man in the Word of God. The reader is unable to do this in any Bible translation that does not
highlight supplied words.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">We believe that the translators should translate the Greek into English as literally as possible (within the scope of
readability) and should not<span style="font-weight: bold"> </span>commentate, indoctrinate, or follow man-made tradition. That is, insert the translator&#8217;s
opinion on what the verse means. For example,</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">John 3:16:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">For* God so loved* the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, in order that everyone who believes in him might

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">&#8216;For God loved the world in this way: He gave His One and Only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The translators of the HCSB made a conditional statement (might not perish) into a &#8216;proof positive&#8217; statement by a
simple verb tense change (will not perish) and they are not the only ones to have done this (NASB, NIV, etc.).</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"> Also,
in the second part, &#8216;may have everlasting life&#8217; was changed to &#8216;have everlasting life.&#8217; Almost all other translations

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Bottom line, the MLV is almost 6 times more accurate than the ESV, 4 times the NASB, 3.5 the NKJV, 3 times the
KJV. </span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The first 3 columns, Modern Literal Version, King James Version and the New American Standard Bible are from
concordances. They are the most accurate of all. The English Standard Version came from Logos software and even
with a second revision is low, due to all the paraphrase in the ESV. The New King James Version came from
Accordance 10; it is high by about 10%.  It would be great if all Bibles could come from multiple identical sources,
but that option is not available until the publishers do their jobs better. The MLV wants you to find &#8220;thus saith the
Greek&#8221; mistakes so we are providing a complete series of reference books to help. </span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">If you have any other translation information or wish to compile such to add to this chart, please send it along to
mlvbible@gmail.com.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">In conclusion, The King James Version uses almost 3 times as many words or phrases for the corresponding Greek
words than does the Modern Literal Version and the &#8216;New American Standard Bible&#8217; 1995 uses over 4 times as
many. The &#8216;New King James Version&#8217; falls in between them. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The English Standard Version is bottom of the list due
to all of its paraphrasing. As literal as the King James Version was, Jay P. Green Sr. in his revision of the
Englishman&#8217;s Concordance showed the English word &#8216;will&#8217; (not future tense) was used for 69 different Greek words.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
So the Modern Literal Version does meet its claim to be the &#8216;world&#8217;s most accurate Bible translation.&#8217;</span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The English language has 450,000 base words of which could be used to translate the 5401 Greek words of which make
up the Greek New Testament. About 600 Bible Greek words actually have more than one meaning even after careful
consideration of which English word to substitute; the context determines which meaning is used. Of the 5401 different
Greek words, 1877 only occur once, 589 are proper names, 1450 are compounds of two words that should be translated
the same or very similarly as if the two words were not in compound or contracted form. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">No language can be treated
purely like a math equation; however, the MLV represents a best effort to do so.</span></span></span></p>

have no Greek counterpart (just Helper words). Even with 450,000 English words, English just doesn&#8217;t have enough
synonyms for everyone of the 5401 Greek words. (Sorry, this list is not finished with all the explanations, i.e. (... )
