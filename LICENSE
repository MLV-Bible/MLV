© Copyright 1999, 2016 by G. Allen Walker, Co-Editor. World-wide restrictions as follows:

We are not here to make money and we will entertain requests for any items not listed below.

1. The purpose of a Copyright is to prevent others from claiming a Copyright and subsequently altering the text.

2. When quoting the Modern Literal Version, the quotes are to be noted by Modern Literal Version or MLV. Footnoting larger amounts is totally acceptable.

3. This translation may be used in any Bible commentary, study module, tract, class book, or similar study materials as long as it is noted according to the guidelines above, and the MLV’s part does not exceed 80% of the volume of the total project; so ‘have at it.’ Essentially, you may quote 6,000 verses without permission. (Contact us, we will be happy to assist you in the completion of your project.)

4. After 80% you are prohibited from selling the Copyrighted MLV! Are you aware of violations? Please let us know.

5. Incorporation of the MLV into a computer-generated software format, non-profit or give-away, is permissible, provided that you have initiated a request to do so in writing. Should you violate our restrictions, and sell your product, any MLV notation must be removed from the product. If you find any software or module that is not linked from our main web page, consider the files there as being altered, pirated or may potentially contain spyware.

6. The HTML version and search engine can be reproduced on other web sites but requires permission. (There are too many OLD copies of the MLV around and we would like to have those updated.)

7. Createspace.com, an on-demand publishing company, (link below) is the current publisher of the Modern Literal Version printed edition and has been since Oct. 2013. Please, whenever possible, buy directly from them (more of your money stays in the USA.)

8. The authorized Kindle edition is available only from amazon.com in BOLD Letter for color blind people and Kindles or Red Letter Editions.
